Background. America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nation s economic prosperity. In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regula- tions have impeded the development of these resources, limited the genera- tion of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens. These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utili- ties, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security. It is thus in the national interest to unleash America s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity includ- ing for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years. It will also rebuild our Nation s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States: (a) to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future; (b) to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states; (c) to protect the United States s economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation; (d) to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law; (e) to eliminate the  electric vehicle (EV) mandate  and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable; (f) to safeguard the American people s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries; (g) to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action shall, whenever evaluated, be reported separately from its domestic costs and VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4 8 C O D S E R P h t i w D O R P 4 4 1 S 7 W 9 K S D n o d n o m m a h k 8354 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents benefits, in order to promote sound regulatory decision making and prioritize the interests of the American people; (h) to guarantee that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, peer-reviewed sci- entific analysis; and (i) to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required by law. Sec. 3. Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Development of Domestic Energy Resources. (a) The heads of all agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agen- cy actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources  with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources or that are otherwise incon- sistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restric- tions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances. (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law. The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section. (c) Agencies shall promptly notify the Attorney General of any steps taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section so that the Attorney General may, as appropriate: (i) provide notice of this Executive Order and any such actions to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation in which such actions may be relevant; and (ii) request that such court stay or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the com- pletion of the administrative actions described in this order. (d) Pursuant to the policy outlined in section 2 of this order, the Attorney General shall consider whether pending litigation against illegal, dangerous, or harmful policies should be resolved through stays or other relief. Sec. 4. Revocation of and Revisions to Certain Presidential and Regulatory Actions.

(d) The head of any agency that has taken action respecting offices and programs in subsection (a) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all such actions are terminated or, if necessary, appropriate, or required by law, that such activities are transitioned to other agencies or entities. (e) Any contract or agreement between the United States and any third party on behalf of the entities or programs abolished in subsection (a) of this section, or in furtherance of them, shall be terminated for convenience, or otherwise, as quickly as permissible under the law. Sec. 5. Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting. (a) Execu- tive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality) is hereby revoked. (b) To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and propose rescinding CEQ s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq. (c) Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall convene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level imple- menting regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118 5). Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process. (d) The Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule.

Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects. (e) The Director of the NEC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare recommendations to Congress, which shall: (i) facilitate the permitting and construction of interstate energy transpor- tation and other critical energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pipelines, particularly in regions of the Nation that have lacked such development in recent years; and (ii) provide greater certainty in the Federal permitting process, including, but not limited to, streamlining the judicial review of the application of NEPA. Sec. 6. Prioritizing Accuracy in Environmental Analyses. (a) In all Federal permitting adjudications or regulatory processes, all agencies shall adhere to only the relevant legislated requirements for environmental considerations and any considerations beyond these requirements are eliminated. In ful- filling all such requirements, agencies shall strictly use the most robust methodologies of assessment at their disposal and shall not use methodolo- gies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated. (b) The Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which was established pursuant to Executive Order 13990, is hereby disbanded, and any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy including: (i) the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policy- making); (ii) the Report of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Inter- agency Working Group of November 2023 (National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Informa- tion System); (iii) the Technical Support Document of February 2021 (Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990); and (iv) estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases, including the estimates for the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, or the social cost of nitrous oxide based, in whole or in part, on the IWG s work or guidance. (c) The calculation of the  social cost of carbon  is marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation. Its abuse arbitrarily slows regulatory decisions and, by rendering the United States economy internationally uncompetitive, encourages a greater human impact on the environment by affording less efficient foreign energy producers a greater share of the global energy and natural resource market. Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA shall issue guidance to address these harmful and detrimental inadequacies, including consideration of eliminating the  social cost of carbon  calculation from any Federal permitting or regu- latory decision. (d) Prior to the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, agencies shall ensure estimates to assess the value of changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from agency actions, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international effects and evaluating appro- priate discount rates, are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A 4 of September 17, 2003 (Regu- latory Analysis). (e) Furthermore, the head of each agency shall, as appropriate and con- sistent with applicable law, initiate a process to make such changes to VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4 8 C O D S E R P h t i w D O R P 4 4 1 S 7 W 9 K S D n o d n o m m a h k Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents 8357 any rule, regulation, policy or action as may be necessary to ensure consist- ency with the Regulatory Analysis. (f) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA, in collaboration with the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit joint recommendations to the Director of OMB on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator s findings,  Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,  Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009). Sec. 7. Terminating the Green New Deal. (a) All agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117 169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117 58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and shall review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disburse- ments of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agency heads shall submit a report to the Director of the NEC and Director of OMB that details the findings of this review, including recommendations to enhance their alignment with the policy set forth in section 2. No funds identified in this subsection (a) shall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt. (b) When procuring goods and services, making decisions about leases, and making other arrangements that result in disbursements of Federal funds, agencies shall prioritize cost-effectiveness, American workers and businesses, and the sensible use of taxpayer money, to the greatest extent. The Director of OMB shall finalize and circulate guidelines to further implement this subsection. (c) All agencies shall assess whether enforcement discretion of authorities and regulations can be utilized to advance the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB identifying any such instances. Sec. 8. Protecting America s National Security. (a) The Secretary of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible, consistent with applicable law. In assessing the  Public Interest  to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employ- ment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application. (b) With respect to any proposed deepwater port for the export of liquefied natural gas (project) for which a favorable record of decision (ROD) has previously been issued pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), 33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq., the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall, within 30 days of the date of this order and consistent with applicable law, determine whether any refinements to the project pro- posed subsequent to the ROD are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that substantially differ from those associated with the origi- nally-evaluated project so as to present a seriously different picture of the foreseeable adverse environmental consequences (seriously different con- sequences). In making this determination, MARAD shall qualitatively assess any difference in adverse environmental consequences between the project with and without the proposed refinements, including any potential con- sequences not addressed in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which shall be considered adequate under NEPA notwithstanding any revi- sions to NEPA that may have been enacted following the final EIS. MARAD shall submit this determination, together with a detailed justification, to the Secretary of Transportation and to the President.

(d) If MARAD determines, with concurrence from the Secretary of Trans- portation, that such proposed refinements are likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall, within 60 days after submitting such deter- mination, issue an Environmental Assessment (EA) examining such con- sequences and, with respect to all other environmental consequences not changed due to project refinements, shall reaffirm the conclusions of the final EIS. Within 30 days after issuing the EA, MARAD shall issue an addendum to the ROD, if necessary, and shall, within 30 additional days, issue a DWPA license consistent with the ROD. Sec. 9. Restoring America s Mineral Dominance. (a) The Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the EPA, Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise or rescind such actions. (b) The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture shall reassess any public lands withdrawals for potential revision. (c) The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium. (d) The Secretary of the Interior shall prioritize efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the United States, with a focus on locating previously unknown deposits of critical minerals. (e) The Secretary of Energy shall ensure that critical mineral projects, including the processing of critical minerals, receive consideration for Federal support, contingent on the availability of appropriated funds. (f) The United States Trade Representative shall assess whether exploitative practices and state-assisted mineral projects abroad are unlawful or unduly burden or restrict United States commerce. (g) The Secretary of Commerce shall assess the national security implica- tions of the Nation s mineral reliance and the potential for trade action. (h) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall assess the quantity and inflow of minerals that are likely the product of forced labor into the United States and whether such inflows pose a threat to national security and, within 90 days of the date of this order, shall provide this assessment to the Director of the NEC. (i) The Secretary of Defense shall consider the needs of the United States in supplying and maintaining the National Defense Stockpile, review the legal authorities and obligations in managing the National Defense Stockpile, and take all appropriate steps to ensure that the National Defense Stockpile will provide a robust supply of critical minerals in event of future shortfall. (j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations. (k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Sec. 10.

The background section of the Order explicitly states that it is an implementation of E.O. 14057, \"Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability,\" and it adopts the specific government-wide goals of that order, including targets for 100% carbon pollution-free electricity, 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions, and a net-zero emissions building portfolio.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order 14154\n\nExecutive Order 14154, \"Unleashing American Energy,\" signed on January 20, 2025, establishes a new federal policy to promote domestic energy exploration and production, with a focus on oil, natural gas, and coal. It seeks to reduce regulatory burdens that impede energy development and to restore \"consumer choice\" by removing policies that favor certain technologies, such as electric vehicles (EVs). The E.O. directs all federal agencies to review and rescind existing regulations, orders, and policies that are inconsistent with this new directive. Most notably, it explicitly revokes a list of prior executive orders related to climate change and sustainability.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nExecutive Order 14154 directly and fundamentally affects GSA Order ADM 1100.1. The applicability is not incidental; the new E.O. eliminates the entire legal and policy foundation upon which the GSA Order was built.\n\n*   **Direct Revocation of Foundational Authority:** Section 4(a)(ix) of E.O. 14154 explicitly revokes E.O. 14057, \"Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability.\" GSA Order ADM 1100.1, in its own \"Background\" section, identifies E.O. 14057 as its primary authority and the source of its core objectives. With the revocation of E.O. 14057, GSA Order ADM 1100.1 is now based on a rescinded directive and is therefore invalid.\n\n*   **Conflict of Policy and Purpose:** The core purposes of the two documents are in direct opposition.\n    *   GSA Order ADM 1100.1 is designed to achieve \"net zero\" emissions and prioritize climate response.\n    *   E.O. 14154 is designed to \"unleash American energy\" by promoting fossil fuel development and removing what it terms \"ideologically motivated regulations\" related to climate change.\n\n*   **Specific Mandate Contradictions:** Several specific goals within GSA Order ADM 1100.1, inherited from the now-revoked E.O. 14057, are directly contradicted by the new E.O. 14154. For example:\n    *   The GSA Order\u2019s goal of \"100 percent zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035\" is in direct conflict with Section 2(e) of E.O. 14154, which directs the elimination of the \"electric vehicle (EV) mandate\" and the removal of market distortions that favor EVs.\n    *   The GSA Order's goals for a \"net-zero emissions building portfolio\" and \"net-zero emissions from Federal procurement\" are inconsistent with the directive in E.O. 14154 Section 3(a) to identify and remove agency actions that \"impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources.\"\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nE.O. 14154 requires immediate action from all agency heads. To bring GSA into compliance, the following steps are necessary:\n\n1.  **Immediate Formal Identification:** Pursuant to Section 3(a) of E.O. 14154, the GSA Administrator must formally identify GSA Order ADM 1100.1 as an \"agency action\" that is \"inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2\" of the new E.O.\n2.  **Develop Action Plan for Rescission:** Per Section 3(b), GSA must, within 30 days of the date of the E.O., develop and begin implementing an action plan to \"suspend, revise, or rescind\" GSA Order ADM 1100.1. Given that the Order's entire legal basis has been revoked, the only appropriate action is a full rescission.\n3.  **Issue Suspension Guidance:** The Administrator should immediately issue internal guidance to all relevant GSA Services and Staff Offices (e.g., Public Buildings Service, Federal Acquisition Service) to suspend all activities being undertaken solely for the purpose of complying with the goals outlined in GSA Order ADM 1100.1, pending its formal rescission.\n4.  **Consult with General Counsel:** The Office of the Administrator should consult with the Office of General Counsel to ensure the process for rescinding GSA Order ADM 1100.1 is executed in a manner consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n**Final Determination: Affected**",

      "phase2_response": "**Final Decision:** [Affected]\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1.  **Policy Domain/Subject Area:** The GSA policy, \"1100.1ADM, Prioritizing GSA Response to the Climate Crisis,\" is explicitly focused on environmental policy and federal agency operations. Its purpose is to direct the General Services Administration (GSA) to make responding to the climate crisis a primary goal in its activities, which include managing federal buildings, procurement, and fleet services.\n\n2.  **Executive Order Domain/Subject Area:** The Executive Order, \"Unleashing American Energy,\" centers on national energy policy. The title and the background text, which mentions America's \"abundance of energy and natural resources\" and a desire to remove \"burdens,\" strongly indicate a focus on increasing domestic energy production, which historically implies an emphasis on fossil fuels and a reduction in regulatory constraints.\n\n3.  **Direct/Indirect Impact Analysis:** There is a direct and significant impact. The policy and the executive order represent opposing strategic priorities.\n    *   The GSA policy directs the agency to prioritize climate-friendly actions, such as increasing building efficiency, procuring zero-emission vehicles, and using renewable energy sources.\n    *   The Executive Order directs the federal government to prioritize the expansion of domestic energy production. Such orders often lead to the rollback of environmental regulations, streamlining of permits for fossil fuel projects, and a de-emphasis on climate change as a critical factor in government decision-making.\n    *   This creates a direct conflict. The top-down directive from the executive order to \"unleash energy\" would fundamentally alter the operating environment and mandates for the GSA, likely requiring a re-evaluation, modification, or even rescission of its policy to prioritize climate response.\n\n4.  **Key Language Supporting Determination:**\n    *   **Policy:** The title itself, **\"Prioritizing GSA Response to the Climate Crisis,\"** establishes a clear and specific agency-level priority.\n    *   **Executive Order:** The title **\"Unleashing American Energy\"** signals a significant shift in national policy. The phrase implies removing restrictions and promoting production, which is in direct tension with the goals of climate crisis mitigation.\n\n5.  **Nuances and Assessment:** While the provided text for the EO is a short excerpt, its title and stated intent are unambiguous. An executive order sets the tone and direction for the entire executive branch. An order focused on \"unleashing energy\" would supersede a subordinate agency's policy that might be seen as a \"burden\" to that goal. Therefore, the GSA's ability to implement its climate policy as written would be directly affected by the new national priority established by the President.",

The model does not provide any reasoning; it simply identifies the policy by its title and number.\n*   **Focus of Content:** The SME's justification focuses on the *impact of the executive order* on the policy's legal foundation. The model's text only describes the *subject of the GSA policy* itself and makes no mention of the executive order or its effects.\n*   **Analytical Depth:** The SME offers a high-level, substantive conclusion about a legal and regulatory conflict. The model's text is purely descriptive metadata with zero analytical content.\n\nCommentary:\nThe model's output is not a justification and fails completely to replicate the SME's reasoning. It appears to have mistaken the task of providing a justification for the simpler task of identifying the policy in question. While correctly identifying the policy domain is a potential first step in an analysis, it is not the analysis itself. The SME provides a concise, expert-level conclusion that gets to the heart of the compliance issue. The model provides no reasoning whatsoever, making its response useless for understanding the compliance determination."
