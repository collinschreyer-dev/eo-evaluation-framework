Instructions and Procedures 8.A. SPE Acquisition Review Briefing (ARB) Request 8.A.1 When To Conduct an ARB An ARB with the SPE must be conducted as early in the acquisition life cycle as possible (e.g. market research phase) to identify any issues up front and to help expedite the final approval . The ARB should occur prior to the preparation of the document that will need the SPE s signature. 8.A.2 Preparing for the ARB The ARBs should focus on high-level considerations, covering the topics identified at GSAM 504.7102(d). The contracting activity shall prepare slides in advance in Google slides using this ARB Template . Do not edit the template. Instead, make a copy of the template. Since the slides will be shared with the SPE in advance, the contracting activity should not expect to read the slides during the ARB. Rather, the contracting activity should expect a dialogue with the SPE. PIB 21-04 2 The contracting activity shall mark presentation slides with source selection information in accordance with FAR Subpart 3.104-4(c). The ARB will be scheduled for one hour . Attachment 1 identifies the individuals who will be invited to the ARB. 8.A.3 How to Request an ARB When a contracting activity has identified the need for an ARB with the SPE, they shall submit an email to the PBS Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) Policy and Programs Division (PQA), at pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov with the following information: (1) Description of the need for SPE involvement (e.g., SPE approval of a consolidation determination); (2) Description of the requirement, including key milestones (e.g., anticipated solicitation date, anticipated award date); (3) Suggested date(s) of acquisition review(s); (4) ARB slides ( in Google slides using this ARB Template ); (5) A list of regional attendees (see Attachment 1 for attendee list); and (6) Any other important information. Requests to OAM for an ARB with the SPE should be made at least fifteen business days prior to the suggested date of the ARB. Within five business days of receiving the request, OAM will:   Send an email to spe.request@gsa.gov with the information contained in GSAM 504.7104(b);   Send out a calendar invitation for the ARB to all required and optional attendees; and   Coordinate with Central Office OGC on review and comments, and provide any comments to the contracting activity. All of the information provided, including the slides, will be reviewed by OAM prior to sharing with the SPE. Once any comments have been addressed, OAM will add the slides and any draft documents to the calendar invitation. Draft documents are not required for an ARB, and any draft documents provided will still need to go through a formal SPE review and approval process after the ARB. PIB 21-04 3 8.A.4 Special Considerations for Consolidation and Bundling Determinations Consolidation and Bundling Determinations require an understanding of the consolidation and bundling process, understanding of a  new requirement  , 1 in-depth market research, early coordination with the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), and an analysis of cost savings prior to the scheduling of an ARB with the SPE. See Attachment 2 for best practices for consolidation and bundling determination reviews. 8.A.5 ARB Summary Within five business days after the ARB, OAM will provide a summary to all attendees that will include any recommendations and action items. 8.B. SPE Final Document Approval 8.B.1 OAM Routing Following the SPE ARB, after a contracting activity has prepared the document requiring SPE review and received all regional-level concurrences, they shall submit the document for OAM review to pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov with the following information: (1) Description of the requirement, action required, and due date; (2) Separate the signature page from the rest of the document. This will allow changes to be made without having to go through the entire signature approval process again; Unless there are significant changes ( e.g., changes that materially impact the acquisition strategy and opportunities relating to small business, competition, category management) , documents do not always have to be rerouted for signature. Provided as an attachment to this PIB is a document routing template that can be modified and used, as appropriate; however, a signed pdf should be submitted; 1 To determine if the expansion or modification of an existing requirement would be considered a  new  requirement, several factors must be considered: (1) Whether the scope has changed significantly, requiring different types of work or capabilities; (2) Whether the magnitude or value of the requirement has changed significantly, such as greater than 25 percent; (3) Whether the end use of the requirement has changed; and (4) Whether the requirements have meaningfully changed, such as new technical specifications, different delivery schedules, or new performance locations.  New  requirements would not have been previously provided and would not meet the definition of consolidation or bundling; therefore, new requirements do not require a written determination. See Consolidation and Bundling FAQs for additional information. PIB 21-04 4 (3) Share the main body of the document as a Google document to enable reviewers to easily enter comments or suggested edits (or utilize a comment matrix if more practical for the circumstances and document type(s)) ; (4) Supporting attachments, if applicable; (5) Any other important information. OAM will coordinate with the Central Office OGC on review and comments, and will provide any comments to the contracting activity within five business days of receiving the information. Once comments from OAM/OGC have been addressed (if any), OAM/OGC will sign the document and OAM will return the document to the contracting activity. 8.B.2 SPE Routing The contracting activity shall follow the procedures in GSAM 504.7104(c) and OGP s Step 2 - Final Document Approval and submit the required email to the SPE at spe.request@gsa.gov and, if necessary, OSDBU at osdbu_review_concurrence@gsa.gov with a carbon copy to OAM at pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov . 9. Point of Contact Any questions regarding the PIB may be addressed to the PBS Office of Acquisition Management at pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov . 10.

Background. America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nation s economic prosperity. In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regula- tions have impeded the development of these resources, limited the genera- tion of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens. These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utili- ties, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security. It is thus in the national interest to unleash America s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity includ- ing for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years. It will also rebuild our Nation s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States: (a) to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future; (b) to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states; (c) to protect the United States s economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation; (d) to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law; (e) to eliminate the  electric vehicle (EV) mandate  and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable; (f) to safeguard the American people s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries; (g) to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action shall, whenever evaluated, be reported separately from its domestic costs and VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\FR\FM\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4 8 C O D S E R P h t i w D O R P 4 4 1 S 7 W 9 K S D n o d n o m m a h k 8354 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents benefits, in order to promote sound regulatory decision making and prioritize the interests of the American people; (h) to guarantee that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, peer-reviewed sci- entific analysis; and (i) to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required by law. Sec. 3. Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Development of Domestic Energy Resources. (a) The heads of all agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agen- cy actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources  with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources or that are otherwise incon- sistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restric- tions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances. (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law. The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section. (c) Agencies shall promptly notify the Attorney General of any steps taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section so that the Attorney General may, as appropriate: (i) provide notice of this Executive Order and any such actions to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation in which such actions may be relevant; and (ii) request that such court stay or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the com- pletion of the administrative actions described in this order. (d) Pursuant to the policy outlined in section 2 of this order, the Attorney General shall consider whether pending litigation against illegal, dangerous, or harmful policies should be resolved through stays or other relief. Sec. 4. Revocation of and Revisions to Certain Presidential and Regulatory Actions. (a) The following are revoked and any offices established therein are abolished: (i) Executive Order 13990 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis); (ii) Executive Order 13992 of January 20, 2021 (Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation); (iii) Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad); (iv) Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology); (v) Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration); (vi) Executive Order 14027 of May 7, 2021 (Establishment of the Climate Change Support Office); VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\FR\FM\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4 8 C O D S E R P h t i w D O R P 4 4 1 S 7 W 9 K S D n o d n o m m a h k Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents 8355 (vii) Executive Order 14030 of May 20, 2021 (Climate-Related Financial Risk); (viii) Executive Order 14037 of August 5, 2021 (Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks); (ix) Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability); (x) Executive Order 14072 of April 22, 2022 (Strengthening the Nation s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies); (xi) Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022); and (xii) Executive Order 14096 of April 21, 2023 (Revitalizing Our Nation s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All). (b) All activities, programs, and operations associated with the American Climate Corps, including actions taken by any agency shall be terminated immediately. Within one day of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a letter to all parties to the  American Climate Corps Memorandum of Understanding  dated December 2023 to terminate the memorandum, and the head of each party to the memorandum shall agree to the termination in writing. (c) Any assets, funds, or resources allocated to an entity or program abolished by subsection (a) of this section shall be redirected or disposed of in accordance with applicable law. (d) The head of any agency that has taken action respecting offices and programs in subsection (a) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all such actions are terminated or, if necessary, appropriate, or required by law, that such activities are transitioned to other agencies or entities. (e) Any contract or agreement between the United States and any third party on behalf of the entities or programs abolished in subsection (a) of this section, or in furtherance of them, shall be terminated for convenience, or otherwise, as quickly as permissible under the law. Sec. 5. Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting. (a) Execu- tive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality) is hereby revoked. (b) To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and propose rescinding CEQ s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq. (c) Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall convene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level imple- menting regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118 5). Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process. (d) The Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule.

Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects. (e) The Director of the NEC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare recommendations to Congress, which shall: (i) facilitate the permitting and construction of interstate energy transpor- tation and other critical energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pipelines, particularly in regions of the Nation that have lacked such development in recent years; and (ii) provide greater certainty in the Federal permitting process, including, but not limited to, streamlining the judicial review of the application of NEPA. Sec. 6. Prioritizing Accuracy in Environmental Analyses. (a) In all Federal permitting adjudications or regulatory processes, all agencies shall adhere to only the relevant legislated requirements for environmental considerations and any considerations beyond these requirements are eliminated. In ful- filling all such requirements, agencies shall strictly use the most robust methodologies of assessment at their disposal and shall not use methodolo- gies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated. (b) The Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which was established pursuant to Executive Order 13990, is hereby disbanded, and any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy including: (i) the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policy- making); (ii) the Report of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Inter- agency Working Group of November 2023 (National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Informa- tion System); (iii) the Technical Support Document of February 2021 (Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990); and (iv) estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases, including the estimates for the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, or the social cost of nitrous oxide based, in whole or in part, on the IWG s work or guidance. (c) The calculation of the  social cost of carbon  is marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation. Its abuse arbitrarily slows regulatory decisions and, by rendering the United States economy internationally uncompetitive, encourages a greater human impact on the environment by affording less efficient foreign energy producers a greater share of the global energy and natural resource market. Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA shall issue guidance to address these harmful and detrimental inadequacies, including consideration of eliminating the  social cost of carbon  calculation from any Federal permitting or regu- latory decision. (d) Prior to the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, agencies shall ensure estimates to assess the value of changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from agency actions, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international effects and evaluating appro- priate discount rates, are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A 4 of September 17, 2003 (Regu- latory Analysis).

(f) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA, in collaboration with the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit joint recommendations to the Director of OMB on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator s findings,  Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,  Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009). Sec. 7. Terminating the Green New Deal. (a) All agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117 169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117 58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and shall review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disburse- ments of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agency heads shall submit a report to the Director of the NEC and Director of OMB that details the findings of this review, including recommendations to enhance their alignment with the policy set forth in section 2. No funds identified in this subsection (a) shall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt. (b) When procuring goods and services, making decisions about leases, and making other arrangements that result in disbursements of Federal funds, agencies shall prioritize cost-effectiveness, American workers and businesses, and the sensible use of taxpayer money, to the greatest extent. The Director of OMB shall finalize and circulate guidelines to further implement this subsection. (c) All agencies shall assess whether enforcement discretion of authorities and regulations can be utilized to advance the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB identifying any such instances. Sec. 8. Protecting America s National Security. (a) The Secretary of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible, consistent with applicable law. In assessing the  Public Interest  to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employ- ment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application. (b) With respect to any proposed deepwater port for the export of liquefied natural gas (project) for which a favorable record of decision (ROD) has previously been issued pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), 33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq., the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall, within 30 days of the date of this order and consistent with applicable law, determine whether any refinements to the project pro- posed subsequent to the ROD are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that substantially differ from those associated with the origi- nally-evaluated project so as to present a seriously different picture of the foreseeable adverse environmental consequences (seriously different con- sequences). In making this determination, MARAD shall qualitatively assess any difference in adverse environmental consequences between the project with and without the proposed refinements, including any potential con- sequences not addressed in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which shall be considered adequate under NEPA notwithstanding any revi- sions to NEPA that may have been enacted following the final EIS. MARAD shall submit this determination, together with a detailed justification, to the Secretary of Transportation and to the President.

(d) If MARAD determines, with concurrence from the Secretary of Trans- portation, that such proposed refinements are likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall, within 60 days after submitting such deter- mination, issue an Environmental Assessment (EA) examining such con- sequences and, with respect to all other environmental consequences not changed due to project refinements, shall reaffirm the conclusions of the final EIS. Within 30 days after issuing the EA, MARAD shall issue an addendum to the ROD, if necessary, and shall, within 30 additional days, issue a DWPA license consistent with the ROD. Sec. 9. Restoring America s Mineral Dominance. (a) The Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the EPA, Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise or rescind such actions. (b) The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture shall reassess any public lands withdrawals for potential revision. (c) The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium. (d) The Secretary of the Interior shall prioritize efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the United States, with a focus on locating previously unknown deposits of critical minerals. (e) The Secretary of Energy shall ensure that critical mineral projects, including the processing of critical minerals, receive consideration for Federal support, contingent on the availability of appropriated funds. (f) The United States Trade Representative shall assess whether exploitative practices and state-assisted mineral projects abroad are unlawful or unduly burden or restrict United States commerce. (g) The Secretary of Commerce shall assess the national security implica- tions of the Nation s mineral reliance and the potential for trade action. (h) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall assess the quantity and inflow of minerals that are likely the product of forced labor into the United States and whether such inflows pose a threat to national security and, within 90 days of the date of this order, shall provide this assessment to the Director of the NEC. (i) The Secretary of Defense shall consider the needs of the United States in supplying and maintaining the National Defense Stockpile, review the legal authorities and obligations in managing the National Defense Stockpile, and take all appropriate steps to ensure that the National Defense Stockpile will provide a robust supply of critical minerals in event of future shortfall. (j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.

1. Policy Summary (PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04):
This policy provides guidance on the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval process for certain contract actions within the GSA Public Buildings Service. It outlines specific scenarios requiring SPE review, such as class deviations, consolidation/bundling determinations, and justifications for procurement over $75 million.

2. Executive Order Summary:
The executive order ""Unleashing American Energy"" focuses on reducing regulatory burdens, expediting energy resource development, and simplifying federal permitting processes. It revokes several previous climate and environmental executive orders and aims to prioritize energy exploration and production.

3. Applicability Analysis:
While the executive order does not directly address procurement procedures, it has indirect implications for GSA procurement:

Potential Impacts:
- Emphasis on expediting permitting and reducing regulatory barriers
- Focus on cost-effectiveness and efficiency in federal processes
- Potential changes in environmental analysis methodologies
- Potential redirection of funds and review of existing contracts

4. Recommended Next Steps:

a) Internal Review:
- Conduct a comprehensive review of current SPE review processes
- Assess alignment with new executive order's efficiency principles
- Evaluate any potential conflicts with existing procurement guidelines

b) Procedural Adjustments:
- Update ARB (Acquisition Review Briefing) templates to reflect new efficiency requirements
- Revise environmental assessment methodologies
- Ensure procurement documentation emphasizes cost-effectiveness

c) Consultation:
- Coordinate with Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
- Seek guidance from senior leadership on specific implementation details

Disclaimer: This analysis represents a preliminary assessment. For definitive guidance, consult GSA legal and procurement experts.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this analysis?",Not affected,Affected,"The ""Unleashing American Energy"" executive order contains wide-ranging directives that would necessitate review and potential modification of existing procurement procedures, particularly around environmental assessments, cost calculations, and efficiency standards.",Not Affected,"## Policy Analysis: PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04 and Executive Order 14154

### 1. Brief Summary of the Policy Text

PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04 establishes guidance for GSA Public Buildings Service regarding when Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval is required for certain contract actions. The policy outlines four main categories requiring SPE approval:
- Class deviations from Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or GSA Acquisition Regulation (GSAR)
- Consolidation and bundling determinations
- Justifications for other than full and open competition over $75 million
- Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) waiver requests

This is an internal procurement process document that governs approval workflows within GSA's acquisition system.

### 2. Brief Summary of the Executive Order Text

Executive Order 14154, ""Unleashing American Energy,"" establishes a policy framework to promote energy exploration and production on federal lands and waters. The order aims to:
- Encourage energy exploration and production on federal lands and the Outer Continental Shelf
- Position the U.S. as a leading producer of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals
- Protect national and economic security through reliable energy supply
- Remove burdensome regulations that impede energy resource development

The order emphasizes reducing regulatory barriers to energy development and strengthening American energy independence.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability

This executive order does **not directly apply** to PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04. Here's why:

**Scope Mismatch**: The PIB governs internal GSA procurement approval processes, while the executive order focuses on energy policy and resource development regulations. The PIB is a procedural document about acquisition workflows, not a substantive regulation affecting energy development.

**Different Regulatory Domains**: The executive order targets regulations that ""impede energy development"" and affect energy exploration, production, and mineral extraction. The PIB addresses procurement approval authorities within GSA's Public Buildings Service, which primarily deals with federal building construction, renovation, and management services.

**No Direct Energy Development Impact**: The SPE approval processes outlined in the PIB (class deviations, bundling determinations, competition justifications, and CAS waivers) are standard procurement procedures that do not specifically regulate or restrict energy-related activities.

**Procedural vs. Substantive**: The PIB is a procedural instruction that governs internal approval workflows, while the executive order targets substantive regulations that create barriers to energy development.

### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance

Since this policy is not affected by the executive order, no compliance actions are required. However, as a prudent measure:

- **Monitor for Future Guidance**: Watch for any GSA-specific implementation guidance related to the executive order that might affect procurement processes for energy-related projects.
- **Review Energy-Related Procurements**: When the SPE review process is applied to energy sector contracts, ensure alignment with the administration's energy policy objectives.
- **Stay Alert for Policy Updates**: Be prepared to modify approval processes if future directives specifically address procurement procedures for energy development projects.

**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",Not Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal procurement administration and internal approval processes for GSA Public Buildings Service contract actions.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Energy policy deregulation and removal of barriers to American energy development.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact. The policy establishes procedural requirements for SPE review and approval of contract actions, including deviations from FAR. It does not impose substantive restrictions on energy-related procurement or contain provisions that would conflict with energy development objectives. The policy is purely administrative in nature.

4. **Supporting Language**: The policy focuses on ""requesting Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval of certain contract ac","**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**
The policy ""PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04"" operates in the domain of federal procurement and acquisition management. Specifically, it establishes procedures for Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval processes for certain contract actions within GSA's Public Buildings Service, including class deviations from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**
Executive Order 14154 ""Unleashing American Energy"" operates in the domain of energy policy and regulatory reform. It focuses on reducing regulatory burdens on energy and natural resource development to promote economic prosperity, job creation, and energy affordability.

**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**
While these domains are distinct, there is potential for indirect intersection. Energy-related procurement contracts managed by PBS could theoretically be subject to both the SPE approval processes outlined in the policy and any regulatory changes stemming from the executive order. However, the policy itself is purely procedural - it establishes internal review mechanisms rather than substantive procurement requirements or restrictions.

**Step 4: Independent Assessment Context**
The phase1_flag indicates ""Not Affected,"" and upon independent review, this assessment appears accurate. The policy is administratively focused on internal approval processes rather than substantive energy-related procurement rules.

**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal procurement administration and internal approval processes for GSA Public Buildings Service contract actions.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Energy policy deregulation and removal of barriers to American energy development.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact. The policy establishes procedural requirements for SPE review and approval of contract actions, including deviations from FAR. It does not impose substantive restrictions on energy-related procurement or contain provisions that would conflict with energy development objectives. The policy is purely administrative in nature.

4. **Supporting Language**: The policy focuses on ""requesting Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval of certain contract actions"" and ""Class Deviations"" from FAR. The executive order targets ""burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations"" that impede energy development. The policy's procedural nature does not fall into this category.

5. **Edge Cases Considered**: While PBS might procure energy-related services or manage energy-efficient building contracts, the policy itself doesn't regulate the substance of these procurements - only the internal approval process. The executive order would more likely affect substantive energy procurement regulations rather than administrative approval procedures.

The policy remains unaffected as it deals with internal administrative processes rather than substantive energy-related regulatory barriers.",15,"- **Opposite conclusions**: SME finds the policy would require review and modification due to EO impact, while Model concludes there is ""no direct or meaningful indirect impact""

Key Differences:
- **Opposite conclusions**: SME finds the policy would require review and modification due to EO impact, while Model concludes there is ""no direct or meaningful indirect impact""
- **Scope of impact assessment**: SME identifies specific areas of potential conflict (environmental assessments, cost calculations, efficiency standards), while Model dismisses any substantive connection
- **Policy characterization**: SME recognizes substantive implications for procurement procedures, while Model categorizes the policy as ""purely administrative""
- **Risk assessment approach**: SME takes a precautionary view acknowledging ""wide-ranging directives,"" while Model takes a narrow view focusing only on direct procedural elements

Commentary:
The Model's reasoning is fundamentally flawed compared to the SME's analysis. While the Model provides a structured analytical framework, it fails to recognize the substantive implications that the SME correctly identifies. The SME demonstrates superior policy analysis by understanding that procurement procedures involving environmental assessments and efficiency standards would indeed be affected by energy deregulation directives. The Model's conclusion that there is ""no meaningful indirect impact"" suggests it missed the broader policy connections that experienced analysts would recognize. The SME's justification shows more sophisticated understanding of how executive orders can cascade through seemingly unrelated administrative processes."

Overview The President signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), P.L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429, on November 15, 2021 providing $3,418,008,000 to the U.S. General Services Administration for various work on border stations and land ports of entry. Throughout this document this act will be referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The relevant enacted language from the Act is as follows:  For an additional amount to be deposited in the  Federal Buildings Fund , $3,418,008,000, to remain available until expended, for construction and acquisition, and repairs and alterations of border stations and land ports of entry, of which no more than $250,000,000 shall be for Program Contingency and Operational Support for necessary expenses for projects funded under this heading, including, moving governmental agencies (including space alterations and adjustments, and telecommunications relocation expenses) in connection with the assignment, allocation and transfer of space, leasing of temporary space, and building operations, of which  (1) $2,527,808,000 shall be for projects on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection five-year plan; (2) $430,200,000 shall be for projects with completed U.S. Customs and Border Protection/General Services Administration feasibility studies as prioritized in the  American Jobs Plan Project List  submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on May 28, 2021; and (3) $210,000,000 shall be for land ports of entry (LPOE) infrastructure paving; acquisition of leased LPOEs; and additional Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration requirements at the Southern Border: Provided, That the General Services Administration shall submit a plan, by project, regarding the use of funds made available to the Administrator under this heading in this Act to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 90 days of enactment of this Act: Provided further, That the Administrator of General Services shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate quarterly on the obligations and expenditures of the funds provided under this heading in this Act by account of the Federal Buildings Fund: Provided further, That funds made available under this heading in this Act for Federal Buildings Fund activities may be transferred to, and merged with, other accounts within the Federal Buildings Fund only to the extent necessary to meet program requirements for such activities: Provided further, That the General Services Administration will provide notice in advance to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate of any proposed transfers: Provided further, That funds made available to the Administrator under this heading in this Act shall not be subject to section 3307 of title 40, United States Code: Provided further, That amounts made available under this heading in this Act shall be in addition to any other amounts made available for such purposes, including for construction and acquisition or repairs and alterations: Provided further, That such amount is designated by the Congress as being 3 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A for an emergency requirement pursuant to section 4112(a) of H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, and to section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.  The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) Office of Budget (BB), Financial Management (BG), and Office of PBS Financial Services (BR), together with the Public Buildings Service (PBS), drafted this guidance document for the management of the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) BIL funds. B. New Accounting Codes 1. Fund 192J Fund 192J has been established in GSA s accounting system, Pegasys, for the use of PBS, and will be used specifically for the obligation of FBF funds appropriated by the BIL. The Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) for fund 192J is the same as the FBF; TAS 47X4542. Please note that the FBF, which is the traditional funding vehicle for PBS, is a no-year quasi-revolving fund and permits PBS to use new obligational authority until expended. As the enacted language states,  For an additional amount to be deposited in the  Federal Buildings Fund , $3,418,008,000, to remain available until expended .. , fund 192J will be structured as a no-year fund in Pegasys . BIL obligations and expenses must not be included in the regular FBF 192X account and reported as such, due to special reporting requirements stipulated for these funds under the Act and apportionment by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Therefore, for ease of reporting, the BIL funding must be tracked and managed separately, using a new fund (fund 192J). For financial reporting, all obligations and outlays will still be reported under the Federal Buildings Fund TAS 47X4542. 2. Budget Activities The BIL appropriated funds in five different spending categories. In order to track and manage each category within the spending plan and apportionment, five budget activities within 192J are created and listed below. These are established for use in fund 192J only, and cannot be used in fund 192X.   PG11 CBP LPOE Five Year Plan Projects: Land Ports of Entry (LPOE) projects on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection five-year plan.   PG12 AJP Priority LPOE Projects: projects with completed U.S. Customs and Border Protection/General Services Administration feasibility studies as prioritized in the  American Jobs Plan Project List  submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on May 28, 2021. 4 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A   PG13 LPOE Paving, Acquisition of Leased LPOE, and FMCSA Projects: for LPOE infrastructure paving; acquisition of leased LPOEs; and additional Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) requirements at the Southern Border.   PG14 Program Contingency: This budget activity will be used for project contingency funds.   Per the public law:  no more than $250,000,000 shall be for Program Contingency and Operational Support for necessary expenses for projects funded under this heading, including, moving governmental agencies (including space alterations and adjustments, and telecommunications relocation expenses) in connection with the assignment allocation and transfer of space, leasing of temporary space, and building operations.    PG15 Operational Support: This budget activity will be used for operational support costs. This funding is capped at $250,000,000 along with the contingency.   Per the public law: no more than $250,000,000 shall be for Program Contingency and Operational Support for necessary expenses for projects funded under this heading, including, moving governmental agencies (including space alterations and adjustments, and telecommunications relocation expenses) in connection with the assignment allocation and transfer of space, leasing of temporary space, and building operations.   At this time, PBS does not plan to issue allowances for operational support from the BIL. Please see section C  Tracking PBS Operating Expenses Related to BIL . All current budget activities in fund 192X will continue to be used only for FBF activities as appropriated, and will not be available under fund 192J. Regular 192X and BIL 192J funding can be used in conjunction with each other on LPOE projects. These situations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in coordination with OCFO, PBS Portfolio, Office of the General Counsel, and the LPOE Program Management Office (PMO). The use of funds for PG11, PG12, PG13, PG14, and PG15 will be directly tied to the approved spending plan. The regions must adhere to the project list as provided in the spend plan. 3. Function Codes and SOCs The existing Function Codes and Sub-Object Classes (SOCs) for 192X will be used for fund 192J. Please apply accounting classification codes in accordance with normal coding guidelines depending on the purchase. Please refer to the PBS Standardized Coding website to find more information. 5 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A C. Tracking PBS Operating Expenses Related to BIL At this time, PBS does not plan to issue allowances for operational support from the BIL and all operating costs will be funded from regular FBF fund 192X. It is still necessary to track 192X costs related to executing the BIL projects. Tracking code Y0000BIL was set up in order to track BIL expenses paid for by regular 192X funding. 1. Travel At this time, all travel continues to be paid from 192X BA60. All travel in Concur for a BIL project need to cite the Y0000BIL tracking code. This code has been loaded in Concur for certain organization codes related to BIL. If the coding for your organization does not appear, please contact your Building Operations budget analyst. 2. Labor Coding/Timecarding Every PBS employee is to follow current business rules regarding timecarding their labor hours to function codes, buildings, projects, and reimbursable work authorizations (RWAs). Employees who work on BIL projects need to code their time to the specific projects as normal. Effective with the pay period beginning 9/25/22 (pay period ending 10/08), those who spend administrative time on BIL work need to code their time to Y0000BIL in HRLinks using the region s dummy building number. This does not apply to SES or PMO employees, or to PBS employees who can code time to individual projects or RWAs. Employees who work full time on BIL projects within the LPOE PMO do not need to timecard to the Y-code as their organization code is already delineated as full time BIL. Please see section E.4 for more information on General & Administrative (G&A) allocation. 3. All Other Management Support contract employees who are not working on a specific project must be coded to Sub Object Class H03 (Contract labor) with tracking code, Y0000BIL. The tracking code will enable GSA to separate out embedded contract employees from other types of contracts. The LPOE PMO must be notified of all new management support contracts supporting the BIL prior to award. All other costs not included in a project or in the BIL spend plan, but related to the BIL, such as training, will continue to use the Y0000BIL code for tracking in 192X. D. Requesting BIL Funds BIL funds will be managed by the PMO through internal tracking and spend planning. As regions prepare to make awards, regions should follow the standard allowance 6 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A request process, with BIL process clarifications below, to obtain the project funding in Pegasys. 1. Allowance Process For PG11-PG14, OCFO PBS Budget Division (BBP) will send instructions for regional project and budget teams to create line item project numbers in IRIS. The best practice is for regions to plan to request project allowances for each major project phase, including appropriate contingency, ensuring appropriate time before award, usually once contract awards are pending. The following procedural requirements for issuing allowances shall be followed:   All allowance request packets must be submitted to the allowance request mailbox (allowance.requests@gsa.gov).   The regional program office must coordinate with the zonal budget analyst to prepare the GSA form 3285 allowance request.   A completed GSA Form 3285 is required as an attachment to the allowance request email. The form must be filled out in its entirety to include all regional approving persons, the appropriation, and the amount that the region is requesting. Also, the description section must include which national spend plan the region is requesting funds from and the purpose for how the funds will be obligated. In addition to the GSA Form 3285, regions need to provide any applicable supporting documents to verify the actual award amount, such as, the contractor's proposal (i.e., Standard Form 1442), to support the allowance request.     Note: for all BIL studies (site acquisition, NEPA, pre-design) allowances, regions may provide the Independent Government Estimate as support.   The zonal budget office will then attach the GSA form 3285, supporting documents, spend plan and submit the funds request email to the Central Office allowance request mailbox (allowance.requests@gsa.gov).   Upon receiving the allowance request, BBP will review the allowance request and then forward the request for approval to the LPOE PMO and Office of Portfolio Management & Customer Engagement. Please allow a lead-time of approximately two days for the Central Office to review and concur.   After OCFO approvals have been obtained, BBP will complete the project allowance in Pegasys. After receiving notification that the allowance has been processed, the regional budget analyst must establish an operating plan (A5 level) in Pegasys.   The new PBS project management system, Kahua, will be automating the allowance creation and approval process. Once that feature is implemented, allowances will be created and routed in Kahua. 7 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A E. Pegasys 1. Pegasys Templates New Pegasys templates and budget activities have been added for fund 192J. Accounting templates for the below organization codes have been created for fund 192J. Templates for additional organization codes can be added as needed, please contact BBP with any questions or to request an organization code. Regional Org Codes available for 192J: An LPOE PMO has been established within Region 2. All PMO costs must be coded to organization code P02L0001. Pegasys accounting templates with the P02L0001 organization code have been created for 192X PG60, PG61 and 192J PG15. 2. Purchase Cards (non-travel) Purchase card users must log their BIL-related transactions into Pegasys using fund 192J, and must remember to perform a timely reconciliation. Any purchase must be in accordance with the approved BIL spend plan and directly supporting a BIL project. Regions must follow all current credit card processes; 192J is available in the credit card bot. 3. Reports The following is a list of Pegasys reports that have been created to include fund 192J financial activity. Business Intelligence (BI) databases will be updated to include transactions from 192J. These reports can be found directly in Pegasys or in BI. 8 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A   FR83AB   Allowance/Budget Plan Status Report   Trial Balance Report   Month-end Obligation Status Reports Income & Expense (I&E) Reports     Fixed Asset Trial Balance Report     ULO Database   Quarterly Commitments and Obligations Report for quarterly reporting to Inventory Status Report Congress (as requested in the act) Additionally, activity will be tracked on the below dashboard as updated by PBS and OCFO:   PMO Financial Tracking Report 4. General & Administration Allocation Fund 192J transactions that are coded without a building number, project number or RWA number will go into the various PBS G&A pools; the particular pool classification will depend on the distribution level of the organization code, just as with other Fund 192 indirect transactions. Likewise, fund 192J direct transactions against a particular building will factor into the distribution of the G&A pools just as with other Fund 192 direct transactions. All regions should evaluate the impact of 192J funding on their workloads when determining the new workload factors for FY23 and forward. As most 192J funding is anticipated to be related to capital projects, regions should pay special attention to the impact on the capitalization factors. The Pegasys cost allocation module and the I&E reports will include the 192J fund transactions in with the other Fund 192 transactions to produce one official set of regional and nationwide FBF I&E reports. For more information, please contact Stefanie Crane at 202-528-8178. 5. Cost Transfers Cost transfers occur after funds are expensed. Cost transfers often correct coding errors or reflect changes in coding decisions. They do not require approval by OMB or Congress, but may require explanation after the fact to OMB, Congress or auditors. Cost transfers can be between funds, budget activities, or projects. Because of the BIL's unique requirements for transparency and because of the multiple levels of review for BIL obligations and expenses, cost transfers initiated by regions are strongly discouraged. No cost transfers may be initiated without prior approval from the OCFO Zonal RWA/Capital Projects Director with the concurrence of BBP. Regions shall request cost transfers between the FBF (192X) and the BIL fund (192J) only when the original obligation is clearly in error, or when the identified scope is clearly miscoded. Likewise, regions will request cost transfers between Budget Activities within 192J only when the original obligation is in error. 9 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A All requests for cost transfers must be submitted by the zonal OCFO capital projects budget analyst and must be submitted to the OCFO Zonal RWA/Capital ProjectsDirector for concurrence, and finally to the BBP Capital Projects team for review and concurrence. This process is for approval only. Once the request is approved, the region must transfer the costs by following normal procedures. F. Property In addition to the PBS Property Accounting Handbook, the following guidance is provided to address the specific changes that must be accomplished due to the BIL. 1. Establishing 192J Funded Projects Projects exceeding $50,000 from 192J funds must be assigned a capitalized Accounting System Identification (ASID) in PBS s Inventory Reporting Information System (IRIS), while projects under $50,000 must be assigned an expensed ASID. Because it is PBS  s policy to capitalize at the ASID level, only one ASID should be used even if the project is funded through 192X and 192J. If the ASID is funded by 192X and 192J, IRIS users need to indicate in the appropriate field that the project is multiple funded and select the corresponding Budget Activity. If a project is funded solely from 192J, the ASID number will be assigned based on the type of work conducted, similar to PBS s process under 192X. Each ASID number should tie back to the original project line item number (or LIN) and, while each project can have multiple ASIDs, there must only be one project line item number for each 192J funded project. New construction projects must continue to be assigned N- type ASIDs. These ASIDs will be funded from Budget Activities PG11 (CBP LPOE Five Year Plan Projects), PG12 (AJP Priority LPOE Projects), PG13 (LPOE Paving, Acquisition of Leased LPOE, and FMCSA Projects) and PG14 (Project Contingency). Should a region have a blended new construction/R&A project, please consult with zonal budget and BBP. Repair and Alteration (R&A) projects exceeding the current prospectus limit will continue to be assigned V-type ASIDs for construction and non-advanced design. Currently, there are no advanced design projects that should be assigned S-type ASIDs under 192J. All R&A projects under prospectus will be assigned R-type ASIDs. The spending plan will list the appropriate budget activities and ASID types to be recorded into IRIS for these projects. Traditionally, LPOE project are funded through new construction using N-type ASIDs; however, depending on the scope of the project, the project may need to be coded as a R&A project and could be funded from PG11-PG14 (if deemed necessary and approved by BBP and the Capital Assessment and Allocation Division (PTB)). Should there be any operating costs funded by BIL, ASIDs will not be required for PG15 (Operating Costs). 10 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A PG14 funds will be used as a source for additional project contingency through a stringent governance process managed by the PMO. Regions should plan to stay within the standard construction contingency for their projects, which is already part of the PG11, 12 and 13 project budgets as included in the spend plan. Regions will need approval from the PMO to receive a budget increase from the PG14 program contingency. If approved, funds will be allowed in PG14 and the contingency accounting string will need to be used on the project. Therefore, PG14 costs related to a specific construction project must cite the N, S, V, or R-type ASID for that project and use the same LIN.

IRIS now has the capability to assign ASIDs to the 192J funded budget activities. As previously discussed, IRIS users need to check the multiple fund indicator for the ASID with the appropriate Budget Activity Code in IRIS. For any environmental-related cleanup costs, a separate ASID with expensed accounting treatment will need to be established for any environmental work items. See Chief Financial Officer Manual, Volume 3, OCFO 4260.3 (May 23, 2019), Chapter 5: Expenses, Part 4 for more details. 2. Monitoring Capitalized Projects As PBS receives additional funding under 192J for existing projects, the capitalization status of projects may change since the scope of work and/or dollar amount may change. For example, if a project originally was expensed since it was primarily for repairs, but additional funding allows PBS to improve the asset beyond its original condition, it must be capitalized if it exceeds PBS s capitalization threshold of $50,000. The capitalization threshold is based on the ASID s delivered orders under both funds and under all budget activities. If a project's capitalization status changes, the Regional IRIS Power User must first adjust the work category code and send an email to PBS.Property@gsa.gov informing BGP of the change and reason. The BGP Property Team will then request financial system adjustments as needed. 11 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A Estimated Substantial Completion Date (ESCD): The ESCD is the planned date for the asset to be ready for its intended purpose, regardless of funding code. The estimated SCD should be updated and maintained in IRIS throughout the life of the project. If the scope of work will change due to additional 192J funds, regional associates should adjust the date as soon as a date is established. Additionally, study, design, and construction award dates should also be entered as incurred to ensure IRIS reflects the proper project status. Actual Substantial Completion Date (ASCD): The ASCD is the actual date the asset can be operated or occupied, even though minor repairs or construction may be needed. It is the date when PBS inspects, approves and determines that work has been performed to bring the project to the degree of completion that is necessary for the asset to be used for its intended purpose. Associated construction or physical, or financial completion dates, that are associated with the project shall not delay reporting of the ASCD. Depreciation: Once the project reaches substantial completion and the ASCD is entered into IRIS, project costs will transfer from the construction-in-process to the completed buildings accounts and depreciation will be recorded. The useful lives of projects, which are based on project type, will remain unchanged, regardless if funded completely or partly under fund 192J.

RWA Tracking The following guidance applies to RWA acceptance and processing for RWAs that support GSAs BIL projects, specifically RWAs from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment. Intake Process: Regions will follow standard PBS RWA policy (Reimbursable Work Authorizations National Policy Manual, PBS 1000.2B (August 1, 2020), as revised). In addition, BIL LPOE RWAs must be approved by the LPOE PMO before accepted by PBS. The LPOE PMO will maintain a list of projected CBP RWAs funded with CBP BIL funding. Note: CBP RWAs funded with BIL funding will contain the following TAS, which indicates the RWA is funded from BIL: 070 2022 2026 0530000 *070 is connected to CBP agency bureau code, then the year of the appropriation and the year of expiration of obligational authority. 0530 is an identifier for O&S projects (CBP s BIL projects) 12 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A Reminder: Any B-type RWAs must be associated with a Project Control Number and ASID code connecting it to the GSA-funded portion of the work (usually V-type or N- type). In addition, the associated PCN must be entered in the PCN field in RETA (see screenshot below). For additional assistance please contact your RWA financial point of contact. H. PBS Systems The following PBS systems have been modified to include the new fund 192J financial activity: a. Kahua b. Capital Projects Application (CPA) c. Business Intelligence/Business Objects d. RETA e. Inventory Reporting Information System (IRIS) 13 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A f. REXUS g.

If you have trouble entering obligations or other transactions, please first check to be sure that you have made no errors, then contact your local budget analyst for further assistance. I. FY 2022 and Beyond $3.418 billion in BIL funding is available for FY22 and beyond as no-year funding. Beginning with the FY2024 Budget Call, OCFO will start estimating impacts to budgets as a result of any completed BIL projects. For example, utilities, cleaning, and maintenance costs will need to be budgeted in the appropriate fiscal year for any new LPOEs or completed projects coming online. 14 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A",14154,23,Unleashing American Energy,Unleashing American Energy.pdf,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jXsuZc5NDFFFU0uUVnxsm43gyvkNm7o_/view?usp=drive_link,"Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents 8353 Presidential Documents Executive Order 14154 of January 20, 2025 Unleashing American Energy By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: Section 1. Background. America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nation s economic prosperity. In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regula- tions have impeded the development of these resources, limited the genera- tion of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens. These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utili- ties, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security. It is thus in the national interest to unleash America s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity includ- ing for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years. It will also rebuild our Nation s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States: (a) to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future; (b) to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states; (c) to protect the United States s economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation; (d) to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law; (e) to eliminate the  electric vehicle (EV) mandate  and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable; (f) to safeguard the American people s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries; (g) to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action shall, whenever evaluated, be reported separately from its domestic costs and VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\FR\FM\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4 8 C O D S E R P h t i w D O R P 4 4 1 S 7 W 9 K S D n o d n o m m a h k 8354 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents benefits, in order to promote sound regulatory decision making and prioritize the interests of the American people; (h) to guarantee that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, peer-reviewed sci- entific analysis; and (i) to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required by law. Sec. 3. Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Development of Domestic Energy Resources. (a) The heads of all agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agen- cy actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources  with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources or that are otherwise incon- sistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restric- tions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances. (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law. The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section. (c) Agencies shall promptly notify the Attorney General of any steps taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section so that the Attorney General may, as appropriate: (i) provide notice of this Executive Order and any such actions to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation in which such actions may be relevant; and (ii) request that such court stay or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the com- pletion of the administrative actions described in this order. (d) Pursuant to the policy outlined in section 2 of this order, the Attorney General shall consider whether pending litigation against illegal, dangerous, or harmful policies should be resolved through stays or other relief. Sec. 4. Revocation of and Revisions to Certain Presidential and Regulatory Actions. (a) The following are revoked and any offices established therein are abolished: (i) Executive Order 13990 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis); (ii) Executive Order 13992 of January 20, 2021 (Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation); (iii) Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad); (iv) Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology); (v) Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration); (vi) Executive Order 14027 of May 7, 2021 (Establishment of the Climate Change Support Office); VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\FR\FM\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4 8 C O D S E R P h t i w D O R P 4 4 1 S 7 W 9 K S D n o d n o m m a h k Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents 8355 (vii) Executive Order 14030 of May 20, 2021 (Climate-Related Financial Risk); (viii) Executive Order 14037 of August 5, 2021 (Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks); (ix) Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability); (x) Executive Order 14072 of April 22, 2022 (Strengthening the Nation s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies); (xi) Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022); and (xii) Executive Order 14096 of April 21, 2023 (Revitalizing Our Nation s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All). (b) All activities, programs, and operations associated with the American Climate Corps, including actions taken by any agency shall be terminated immediately. Within one day of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a letter to all parties to the  American Climate Corps Memorandum of Understanding  dated December 2023 to terminate the memorandum, and the head of each party to the memorandum shall agree to the termination in writing. (c) Any assets, funds, or resources allocated to an entity or program abolished by subsection (a) of this section shall be redirected or disposed of in accordance with applicable law. (d) The head of any agency that has taken action respecting offices and programs in subsection (a) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all such actions are terminated or, if necessary, appropriate, or required by law, that such activities are transitioned to other agencies or entities. (e) Any contract or agreement between the United States and any third party on behalf of the entities or programs abolished in subsection (a) of this section, or in furtherance of them, shall be terminated for convenience, or otherwise, as quickly as permissible under the law. Sec. 5. Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting. (a) Execu- tive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality) is hereby revoked. (b) To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and propose rescinding CEQ s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq. (c) Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall convene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level imple- menting regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118 5). Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process. (d) The Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule.

Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects. (e) The Director of the NEC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare recommendations to Congress, which shall: (i) facilitate the permitting and construction of interstate energy transpor- tation and other critical energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pipelines, particularly in regions of the Nation that have lacked such development in recent years; and (ii) provide greater certainty in the Federal permitting process, including, but not limited to, streamlining the judicial review of the application of NEPA. Sec. 6. Prioritizing Accuracy in Environmental Analyses. (a) In all Federal permitting adjudications or regulatory processes, all agencies shall adhere to only the relevant legislated requirements for environmental considerations and any considerations beyond these requirements are eliminated. In ful- filling all such requirements, agencies shall strictly use the most robust methodologies of assessment at their disposal and shall not use methodolo- gies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated. (b) The Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which was established pursuant to Executive Order 13990, is hereby disbanded, and any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy including: (i) the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policy- making); (ii) the Report of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Inter- agency Working Group of November 2023 (National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Informa- tion System); (iii) the Technical Support Document of February 2021 (Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990); and (iv) estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases, including the estimates for the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, or the social cost of nitrous oxide based, in whole or in part, on the IWG s work or guidance. (c) The calculation of the  social cost of carbon  is marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation. Its abuse arbitrarily slows regulatory decisions and, by rendering the United States economy internationally uncompetitive, encourages a greater human impact on the environment by affording less efficient foreign energy producers a greater share of the global energy and natural resource market. Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA shall issue guidance to address these harmful and detrimental inadequacies, including consideration of eliminating the  social cost of carbon  calculation from any Federal permitting or regu- latory decision. (d) Prior to the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, agencies shall ensure estimates to assess the value of changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from agency actions, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international effects and evaluating appro- priate discount rates, are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A 4 of September 17, 2003 (Regu- latory Analysis).

(f) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA, in collaboration with the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit joint recommendations to the Director of OMB on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator s findings,  Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,  Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009). Sec. 7. Terminating the Green New Deal. (a) All agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117 169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117 58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and shall review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disburse- ments of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agency heads shall submit a report to the Director of the NEC and Director of OMB that details the findings of this review, including recommendations to enhance their alignment with the policy set forth in section 2. No funds identified in this subsection (a) shall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt. (b) When procuring goods and services, making decisions about leases, and making other arrangements that result in disbursements of Federal funds, agencies shall prioritize cost-effectiveness, American workers and businesses, and the sensible use of taxpayer money, to the greatest extent. The Director of OMB shall finalize and circulate guidelines to further implement this subsection. (c) All agencies shall assess whether enforcement discretion of authorities and regulations can be utilized to advance the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB identifying any such instances. Sec. 8. Protecting America s National Security. (a) The Secretary of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible, consistent with applicable law. In assessing the  Public Interest  to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employ- ment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application. (b) With respect to any proposed deepwater port for the export of liquefied natural gas (project) for which a favorable record of decision (ROD) has previously been issued pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), 33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq., the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall, within 30 days of the date of this order and consistent with applicable law, determine whether any refinements to the project pro- posed subsequent to the ROD are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that substantially differ from those associated with the origi- nally-evaluated project so as to present a seriously different picture of the foreseeable adverse environmental consequences (seriously different con- sequences). In making this determination, MARAD shall qualitatively assess any difference in adverse environmental consequences between the project with and without the proposed refinements, including any potential con- sequences not addressed in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which shall be considered adequate under NEPA notwithstanding any revi- sions to NEPA that may have been enacted following the final EIS. MARAD shall submit this determination, together with a detailed justification, to the Secretary of Transportation and to the President.

(d) If MARAD determines, with concurrence from the Secretary of Trans- portation, that such proposed refinements are likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall, within 60 days after submitting such deter- mination, issue an Environmental Assessment (EA) examining such con- sequences and, with respect to all other environmental consequences not changed due to project refinements, shall reaffirm the conclusions of the final EIS. Within 30 days after issuing the EA, MARAD shall issue an addendum to the ROD, if necessary, and shall, within 30 additional days, issue a DWPA license consistent with the ROD. Sec. 9. Restoring America s Mineral Dominance. (a) The Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the EPA, Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise or rescind such actions. (b) The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture shall reassess any public lands withdrawals for potential revision. (c) The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium. (d) The Secretary of the Interior shall prioritize efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the United States, with a focus on locating previously unknown deposits of critical minerals. (e) The Secretary of Energy shall ensure that critical mineral projects, including the processing of critical minerals, receive consideration for Federal support, contingent on the availability of appropriated funds. (f) The United States Trade Representative shall assess whether exploitative practices and state-assisted mineral projects abroad are unlawful or unduly burden or restrict United States commerce. (g) The Secretary of Commerce shall assess the national security implica- tions of the Nation s mineral reliance and the potential for trade action. (h) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall assess the quantity and inflow of minerals that are likely the product of forced labor into the United States and whether such inflows pose a threat to national security and, within 90 days of the date of this order, shall provide this assessment to the Director of the NEC. (i) The Secretary of Defense shall consider the needs of the United States in supplying and maintaining the National Defense Stockpile, review the legal authorities and obligations in managing the National Defense Stockpile, and take all appropriate steps to ensure that the National Defense Stockpile will provide a robust supply of critical minerals in event of future shortfall. (j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.

Executive Order 14154, ""Unleashing American Energy,"" issued January 20, 2025, establishes a policy framework to promote energy exploration and production on federal lands and waters. The order aims to reduce regulatory burdens on energy development, encourage energy exploration including on the Outer Continental Shelf, establish the U.S. as a leading producer of non-fuel minerals including rare earth minerals, and strengthen national security through energy independence. The order emphasizes removing ""burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations"" that have impeded energy resource development.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability
This executive order does **not directly apply** to the GSA policy for the following reasons:

**Scope Differences:**
- The GSA memorandum is purely administrative, focusing on financial tracking and accounting procedures for infrastructure investments
- The executive order targets energy policy and regulatory frameworks affecting energy exploration and production

**Subject Matter Distinction:**
- The GSA policy addresses internal financial management systems for the Federal Buildings Fund
- The executive order addresses substantive energy policy and resource development on federal lands

**Regulatory vs. Administrative Functions:**
- The executive order targets regulatory burdens that impede energy development
- The GSA memorandum establishes internal accounting procedures rather than external regulations

**Infrastructure vs. Energy Focus:**
- While both documents relate to federal activities, the infrastructure investments covered by the GSA policy (federal buildings, facilities) are distinct from the energy exploration and production activities emphasized in the executive order

### 4. Next Steps for Compliance
Since the executive order does not directly impact this financial tracking policy, no immediate compliance actions are required. However, GSA should:

**Monitoring Actions:**
- Monitor for future executive orders or agency guidance that may specifically address infrastructure spending priorities
- Review any BIL-funded projects to ensure they align with the administration's energy policy objectives where applicable

**Coordination Considerations:**
- If any BIL-funded federal building projects include energy-related components (solar installations, energy efficiency upgrades), ensure coordination with the new energy policy framework
- Maintain awareness of how the administration's energy priorities might influence future infrastructure investment decisions

**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",Not Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal infrastructure financial administration - specifically accounting and tracking procedures for Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding through the Federal Buildings Fund.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Domestic energy policy and regulatory reform - focused on removing barriers to energy development and reducing regulatory burdens on the energy sector.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact. The policy establishes administrative procedures (tracking codes, accounting strings) that are independent of energy policy changes. The EO does not address federal appropriations, financial procedures, or GSA operations. While energy policies might influence some infrastructure projects substantively, this policy is purely proc","**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**
The policy is focused on **federal infrastructure investment and financial administration**. Specifically, it provides financial execution guidance for the $3.4 billion appropriated to the Federal Buildings Fund under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law). The policy establishes tracking requirements and accounting procedures for PBS to manage BIL program support costs.

**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**
The executive order focuses on **domestic energy development and regulatory reform**. It addresses removing regulatory barriers to energy resource development, electricity generation, and reducing energy costs to support economic prosperity and national security.

**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**
While both documents relate to federal operations and national infrastructure, they operate in distinctly different domains:
- The policy is purely administrative/financial, dealing with accounting procedures for already-appropriated infrastructure funds
- The executive order is regulatory/policy-focused, targeting energy sector regulations and development

There is **no direct impact** - the EO does not modify financial procedures, accounting requirements, or Federal Buildings Fund operations. There is **minimal indirect impact** - while the EO's energy policies could theoretically affect some infrastructure projects' energy components, this policy document specifically addresses financial tracking and accounting procedures that remain unchanged regardless of energy policy shifts.

**Step 4: Independent Assessment Considering Context**
The phase1_flag of ""Not Affected"" appears accurate. The policy's core function (financial tracking and accounting for BIL funds) is entirely separate from the EO's energy regulatory focus.

**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal infrastructure financial administration - specifically accounting and tracking procedures for Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding through the Federal Buildings Fund.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Domestic energy policy and regulatory reform - focused on removing barriers to energy development and reducing regulatory burdens on the energy sector.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact. The policy establishes administrative procedures (tracking codes, accounting strings) that are independent of energy policy changes. The EO does not address federal appropriations, financial procedures, or GSA operations. While energy policies might influence some infrastructure projects substantively, this policy is purely procedural and remains operationally unchanged.

4. **Supporting Language**: The policy's focus on ""tracking code Y0000BIL in the accounting string for non-labor program requirements"" and ""supplemental financial execution guidance"" represents administrative functions that are not within the scope of the EO's energy regulatory reforms.

5. **Edge Cases Considered**: Even considering that some BIL-funded projects might have energy components affected by the EO, the financial tracking and accounting procedures established by this policy would remain unchanged. The policy is administratively neutral and applies regardless of the underlying project characteristics or regulatory environment.",0,"- **Fundamental contradiction in conclusions**: SME finds direct impact requiring compliance review, while Model concludes no direct or meaningful impact

Key Differences:
- **Fundamental contradiction in conclusions**: SME finds direct impact requiring compliance review, while Model concludes no direct or meaningful impact
- **Opposite interpretation of EO scope**: SME identifies the EO as explicitly pausing IIJA funds, while Model characterizes it as focused solely on energy policy and regulatory reform
- **Different policy domains identified**: SME focuses on financial disbursement processes and infrastructure investments, while Model emphasizes accounting procedures as independent from energy policy
- **Contradictory impact assessments**: SME sees direct impact on GSA financial guidance, while Model sees administrative procedures as unaffected by energy policy changes

Commentary:
The model's reasoning is fundamentally flawed compared to the SME's analysis. The SME correctly identifies that the executive order explicitly addresses IIJA fund pausing and requires comprehensive review of financial disbursement processes - this directly contradicts the model's conclusion that there is ""no direct or meaningful indirect impact."" The model appears to have misunderstood the scope and content of the executive order, treating it as purely an energy policy document when it actually contains specific provisions affecting infrastructure funding mechanisms. The SME's reasoning demonstrates proper understanding of the policy-EO intersection, while the model's analysis misses the core regulatory requirements that would trigger compliance obligations."
