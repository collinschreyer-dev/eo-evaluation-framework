Purpose. The U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) Public Buildings Service (PBS) is committed to integrating risk management and forward-looking science-based climate information into its decision-making processes, programs, operations, business models, and disaster response functions. PBS will use forward-looking science-based climate information to shape investment decisions for long-term hold assets. This enables PBS to develop and integrate adaptive strategies to manage and reduce the risk of operational or financial consequences to both individual facilities and the broader portfolio of owned assets. It also supports reliable performance in changing conditions over assets  intended service lifespans. This Order seeks to manage risks due to observed and expected changes in the environment. To account for the increased frequency of extreme weather and climate- related events, this Order supports the development of a coordinated risk management approach and integrated strategies for reliable and cost effective operations in changing conditions and to secure and safeguard GSA-controlled public assets. This Order complements related laws, GSA policies, Orders, and regulations by affirming that PBS is systematically preparing for changes in the frequency, intensity, duration and geographic distribution of extreme weather-related events and the effects of climate change. PBS is also planning how to manage risk, and how to provide reliable performance in changing conditions over assets  intended asset service lives. This shall be accomplished by integrating risk management and adaptation strategies into all PBS programs, operations, and business models, including portfolio planning and disaster response, for current and future conditions. 2. Background. PBS acquires, designs, builds, operates, leases, and disposes of space for the Federal Government. Given the breadth of PBS s responsibilities, the known and unforeseen vulnerabilities due to the observed and expected changes in the environment and the increased frequency and intensity of weather and natural disasters are having and will DocuSign Envelope ID: EB036CCD-245A-4ADA-A165-0DD7427071E2 PBS 1099.1 continue to have significant impacts on PBS s ability to effectively fulfill its mission to support its customers, coordinate with local communities, operate its facilities, maintain financial stability, avoid maladaptation, and meet its policy requirements. These impacts reflect the timescales of both short-term and slow-onset change, as well as preparing for increased frequency, intensity, duration and geographic distribution of events, and the planning and implementation required for adaptation. Integrating risk management and adaptation strategies into programs, operations and business models, including disaster response and consideration of impacts to local communities surrounding GSA facilities, will enable PBS to execute and manage its mission, operations, and finances securely, effectively, efficiently, and in an environmentally just manner in current and future conditions. 3. Scope and Applicability. This Order and any companion guidance documents apply to all real property management and operation activities for Federal buildings under GSA s jurisdiction, custody, or control, including all buildings delegated to other Federal agencies by the Administrator of General Services. This Order applies to all PBS program actions, including, but not limited to: real property portfolio and asset management; customer engagement; design and construction for new buildings and the alteration of existing buildings; overall building operations and maintenance, and to the extent applicable, leases. 4. Policy. PBS will continue to develop, prioritize, implement, and evaluate actions; and will consider impacts to local communities to integrate plausible projected solutions to vulnerabilities into its mission, programs, management functions, and decision points. This will enable PBS to continually evaluate and manage the short and long term risks to safeguarding assets. PBS will consider and address such impacts when undertaking long-term planning, setting priorities for research and investigations, and informing decisions affecting PBS resources, programs, acquisitions, policies, and operations. 5. Responsibilities. PBS shall consider local coordination, facilities risk management, and adaptation in all its decision making. PBS will ensure that its actions protect and safeguard its assets from current and projected extreme weather impacts and the effects of climate change. Decision makers will ensure that they have reviewed and fully understand the financial and operational impacts and the risks and consequences of each decision, before making any such decision. Review and management of identified safeguarding asset risks will be included in senior leadership performance plans from fiscal year 2024 onward. 2 DocuSign Envelope ID: EB036CCD-245A-4ADA-A165-0DD7427071E2 PBS 1099.1 Capital Projects: PBS Office of Portfolio Management and Customer Engagement (PTCE) and PBS Office of Design and Construction (ODC) shall continue to consider the climate hazards and risks in the selection, design, and delivery of capital projects; accept or mitigate identified risks; and share these risks with GSA Enterprise Risk Management.

Background. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins, and has never been hacked. As a result of its scarcity and security, Bitcoin is often referred to as  digital gold . Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The United States Government currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a policy to maximize BTC s strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system. Just as it is in our country s interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United States Digital Asset Stockpile that can serve as a secure account for orderly and strategic management of the United States  other digital asset holdings. Sec. 3. Creation and Administration of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  Stra- tegic Bitcoin Reserve,  capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency (agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to sub- section (d) of this section (Government BTC). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Govern- ment BTC held by it to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. Government BTC deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law. (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  United States Digital Asset Stockpile,  capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Stockpile Assets). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Stockpile Assets held by it to the United States Digital Asset Stockpile and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine strategies for responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile in accordance with applicable law.

However, the United States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other than in connection with crimi- nal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. (d)  Government Digital Assets  means all Government BTC and all Stock- pile Assets. The head of each agency shall not sell or otherwise dispose of any Government Digital Assets, except in connection with the Secretary of the Treasury s exercise of his lawful authority and responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, as required by law, or in cases where the Attorney General or other relevant agency head determines that the Government Digital Assets (or the proceeds from the sale or disposition thereof) can and should: (i) be returned to identifiable and verifiable victims of crime; (ii) be used for law enforcement operations; (iii) be equitably shared with State and local law enforcement partners; or (iv) be released to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705, 28 U.S.C. 524(c), 18 U.S.C. 981, or 21 U.S.C. 881. (e) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment considerations for establishing and managing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile going forward, including the accounts in which the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile should be located and the need for any legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order or the proper management and administration of such accounts. Sec. 4. Accounting. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall provide the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets with a full accounting of all Govern- ment Digital Assets in such agency s possession, including any information regarding the custodial accounts in which such Government Digital Assets are currently held that would be necessary to facilitate a transfer of the Government Digital Assets to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or the United States Digital Asset Stockpile. If such agency holds no Government Digital Assets, such agency shall confirm such fact to the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets within 30 days of the date of this order. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

1. Policy Summary (GSA PBS 1099.1):
The policy focuses on safeguarding GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) assets in the context of climate change and environmental risks. Key points include:
- Integrating risk management and climate-based information into decision-making
- Developing adaptive strategies to manage operational and financial risks
- Applying climate risk considerations to property management, construction, and facility operations
- Ensuring climate hazard screening and risk assessment for existing buildings

2. Executive Order Summary:
The executive order establishes:
- A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve
- A United States Digital Asset Stockpile
- Procedures for managing government-held digital assets
- Requires agencies to account for and potentially transfer digital assets to these new reserves

3. Applicability Analysis:
The executive order DOES NOT directly affect the PBS 1099.1 policy on asset safeguarding. The policy is specifically about physical infrastructure and climate resilience, while the executive order pertains to digital asset management. There are no points of intersection between the two documents that would require immediate policy modification.

4. Compliance Next Steps:
No immediate action is required for the PBS 1099.1 policy. However, standard GSA procedure would recommend:
- Noting the executive order in internal tracking systems
- Maintaining current climate risk management procedures
- Continuing to implement the existing asset safeguarding policy as outlined

The policy remains fully valid and operational, with no need for revisions based on this executive order.

Recommendation: File this executive order in the appropriate administrative tracking system, but take no further action regarding the PBS 1099.1 policy.",Not affected,Not Affected,"The executive order regarding digital asset management has no material impact on the Public Buildings Service's policy for physical infrastructure climate risk management, as the domains and operational contexts are fundamentally different.",Not Affected,"**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** GSA Leadership
**FROM:** GSA Policy Analyst
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Analysis of Executive Order 14233 on GSA Order PBS 1099.1 (Safeguarding Assets)

This memorandum provides an analysis of the recently issued Executive Order 14233, ""Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,"" to determine its impact on GSA Order PBS 1099.1, ""Safeguarding Assets.""

### 1. Summary of GSA Policy (PBS 1099.1)
GSA Order PBS 1099.1 establishes the Public Buildings Service's (PBS) commitment to safeguarding its assets by integrating risk management and climate science into all decision-making processes. The policy's primary focus is on managing risks to GSA's portfolio of physical, owned assets—specifically federal buildings and infrastructure—from the effects of climate change and extreme weather. The order mandates the development of adaptive strategies to ensure the operational and financial resilience of these physical properties over their intended service lifespans. In this context, ""assets"" refers to tangible, GSA-controlled public properties.

### 2. Summary of Executive Order (14233)
Executive Order 14233 directs the U.S. government to establish a formal policy for managing its holdings of cryptocurrency. It mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to create two new entities: a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" and a ""United States Digital Asset Stockpile."" The purpose is to strategically manage and secure the government's holdings of Bitcoin and other digital assets, which are often acquired through civil and criminal forfeiture proceedings. The order's focus is exclusively on harnessing the strategic and financial potential of digital, cryptographic assets.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability
This executive order **does not apply** to GSA Order PBS 1099.1. The two documents address entirely different categories of assets and operate in separate domains.

The core of the analysis rests on the definition of ""asset"" within each document:
*   **GSA Order PBS 1099.1** is exclusively concerned with **physical assets**. The text repeatedly refers to ""individual facilities,"" the ""portfolio of owned assets,"" ""GSA-controlled public assets,"" and the ""Public Buildings Service."" The entire scope of the policy is the management of real estate and infrastructure in the face of environmental risks.
*   **Executive Order 14233** is exclusively concerned with **digital assets**. The text is specific, naming ""Bitcoin,"" ""cryptocurrency,"" and ""digital assets"" as its subject matter. The order addresses the financial and strategic management of these intangible assets, placing responsibility with the Department of the Treasury.

There is no overlap in the subject matter, purpose, or mandated responsibilities. The GSA policy focuses on the physical security and climate resilience of buildings, while the executive order focuses on the financial and custodial security of government-held cryptocurrency. GSA's Public Buildings Service does not manage digital assets in this capacity, and the executive order places no new requirements on GSA for the management of its real property portfolio.

### 4. Next Steps
As the executive order does not affect GSA Order PBS 1099.1, no specific actions are required to achieve compliance. PBS should continue to implement its asset safeguarding policy as written, focusing on climate-related risk management for its physical infrastructure portfolio. We will continue to monitor all new executive orders for potential impacts on GSA operations and policies.

**Final Determination: Not Affected**",Not Affected,"**

1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:** The policy, ""PBS 1099.1, Safeguarding Assets,"" is issued by the General Services Administration's (GSA) Public Buildings Service (PBS). Its domain is **physical asset management and climate risk mitigation for federal buildings**. The policy text explicitly states its purpose is to integrate ""risk management and forward-looking science-based climate information into its decision-making processes"" to protect its ""broader portfolio of owned assets"" from ""extreme weather and... changes in the environment."" The ""assets"" in this context are clearly tangible, physical properties like federal buildings.

2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, ""Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve a","**Final Decision:** [Not Affected]

**Full Justification:**

1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:** The policy, ""PBS 1099.1, Safeguarding Assets,"" is issued by the General Services Administration's (GSA) Public Buildings Service (PBS). Its domain is **physical asset management and climate risk mitigation for federal buildings**. The policy text explicitly states its purpose is to integrate ""risk management and forward-looking science-based climate information into its decision-making processes"" to protect its ""broader portfolio of owned assets"" from ""extreme weather and... changes in the environment."" The ""assets"" in this context are clearly tangible, physical properties like federal buildings.

2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, ""Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,"" operates in the domain of **national financial and economic policy**. Its focus is on establishing a national reserve of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin (BTC), treating it as a ""unique store of value in the global financial system"" and ""digital gold."" The ""assets"" discussed are intangible digital currencies.

3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** There is no direct or indirect impact from the executive order on the policy. The two documents operate in entirely separate and unrelated domains. The use of the word ""asset"" in both documents is the only superficial similarity, but the context defines the term differently in each case:
    *   **Policy ""Assets"":** Physical real estate (buildings and facilities).
    *   **EO ""Assets"":** Digital currency (Bitcoin).

    A directive to establish a national stockpile of digital currency does not alter the GSA's mandate, procedures, or priorities for safeguarding its physical buildings against climate-related risks. The EO does not mention the GSA, public buildings, infrastructure, or climate change.

4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:**
    *   **Policy Language:** ""Public Buildings Service (PBS),"" ""portfolio of owned assets,"" ""individual facilities,"" ""manage risks due to observed and expected changes in the environment,"" and ""extreme weather."" This language firmly anchors the policy in the realm of physical infrastructure management.
    *   **EO Language:** ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"" ""United States Digital Asset Stockpile,"" ""cryptocurrency,"" ""digital gold,"" and ""global financial system."" This language confines the EO's scope to digital finance and national economic strategy.
    *   The complete lack of overlapping terminology, agencies, or objectives demonstrates that the two documents are not related.

5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** One could theoretically argue that any major new government initiative, like creating a Bitcoin reserve, could have a tertiary budgetary impact on all federal agencies. However, this type of abstract, speculative financial connection is not a direct or indirect policy impact. For a policy to be considered ""Affected,"" the executive order would need to contain a provision that directs a change in the policy's implementation, goals, or the responsibilities of the agency that issued it. This executive order contains no such provision. Therefore, the policy is not affected.",100,"*   **Level of Detail:** The SME justification is a concise, high-level summary of the core reasoning.

Key Differences:
*   **Level of Detail:** The SME justification is a concise, high-level summary of the core reasoning. The model's justification is a detailed, structured analysis that provides specific evidence from the source documents (the policy text) to support its conclusion.
*   **Explicitness:** The model explicitly breaks down its reasoning into two distinct parts (analyzing the policy, then the EO), making the logical steps transparent. The SME combines these into a single, conclusive sentence.

Commentary:
The model's reasoning is identical to the SME's, but it is presented with a much higher degree of analytical rigor. It correctly identifies the fundamental mismatch between the policy's domain (physical assets and climate risk) and the executive order's domain (digital assets).

The model's justification is superior because it doesn't just state the conclusion; it demonstrates *how* that conclusion was reached by citing specific language from the policy. This evidence-based approach makes the reasoning transparent, verifiable, and more compelling than the SME's correct but unsubstantiated summary. The model effectively ""shows its work,"" which is a key characteristic of strong policy analysis."

Purpose. Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single- sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women s domestic abuse shelters to women s workplace showers. This is wrong. Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system. Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself. This unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts. Invalidating the true and biological category of  woman  improperly trans- forms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept. Accordingly, my Administration will defend women s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male. Sec. 2. Policy and Definitions. It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Under my direc- tion, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpre- tation of and application of Federal law and administration policy: (a)  Sex  shall refer to an individual s immutable biological classification as either male or female.  Sex  is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of  gender identity.  (b)  Women  or  woman  and  girls  or  girl  shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively. (c)  Men  or  man  and  boys  or  boy  shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively. (d)  Female  means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell. (e)  Male  means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that pro- duces the small reproductive cell. (f)  Gender ideology  replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true.

Gender ideology is internally incon- sistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body. (g)  Gender identity  reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex. Sec. 3. Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men. (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order. (b) Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. Each agency should therefore give the terms  sex ,  male ,  female ,  men ,  women ,  boys  and  girls  the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications. (c) When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term  sex  and not  gender  in all applicable Federal policies and documents. (d) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees  sex, as defined by section 2 of this order. (e) Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, com- munications, or other internal and external messages that promote or other- wise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. Agency forms that require an individual s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity. Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology. (f) The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single- sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act. This position is legally untenable and has harmed women. The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities. In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent. (g) Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology. Sec. 4.

1. Policy Summary:
The GSA COR (Contracting Officer's Representative) Desk Guide is a comprehensive manual for GSA employees managing building services contracts. It provides guidance on contract administration, responsibilities, documentation, and oversight across various service contract types.

2. Executive Order Summary:
Executive Order 14168 focuses on defining biological sex, restricting gender identity considerations in federal policy, and requiring agencies to use biological sex-based definitions in documentation, forms, and communications.

3. Impact Analysis:
While the Executive Order does not directly invalidate the entire COR Desk Guide, several sections would require review and potential modification:

Potential Affected Sections:
- Background Investigations (Chapter 3)
- Submittals and Deliverables (Chapter 4)
- Documentation (Chapter 5)

Specific Compliance Considerations:
- Forms and documentation must be updated to reflect biological sex
- References to gender identity in contractor personnel documentation may need revision
- Fitness determination processes might require modification to focus solely on biological sex

4. Recommended Next Steps:
a. Conduct a comprehensive policy review
b. Update forms and templates to remove gender identity references
c. Revise background investigation and personnel documentation procedures
d. Consult with GSA legal counsel for precise implementation guidance
e. Develop training for CORs on new documentation requirements
f. Update contract templates and evaluation criteria

SUBJECT: Analysis of Executive Order 14168 and its Impact on the GSA COR Desk Guide for Building Services Contracts

This memorandum provides an analysis of Executive Order 14168 and its potential impact on the GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) COR Desk Guide for Building Services Contracts.

### 1. Summary of the Policy Text
The ""U.S. General Services Administration COR Desk Guide | Building Services Contracts"" is an internal procedural document for GSA personnel, specifically Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs). It provides guidance and standard operating procedures for the administration and oversight of contracts related to building services, such as janitorial, maintenance, and other facility support functions within federal buildings managed by GSA. The guide focuses on the technical and administrative aspects of contract management, including monitoring performance, quality assurance, and processing payments.

### 2. Summary of the Executive Order Text
Executive Order 14168, ""Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,"" establishes a government-wide policy that definitions of sex, male, and female must be based on immutable biological reality. The order's stated purpose is to protect women's rights and safety by ensuring that single-sex spaces, such as workplace showers and restrooms, are reserved for biological females. It directs federal agencies to use clear language and implement policies that reflect these biological definitions, invalidating policies based on subjective gender identity.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability
While the COR Desk Guide itself does not contain explicit policy language regarding gender identity or access to facilities, **it is indirectly but significantly affected by this Executive Order.**

The Desk Guide is an operational tool used to implement and enforce the terms of building services contracts. GSA, as the landlord for much of the federal government, is directly responsible for managing federal building facilities, including restrooms and showers. The Executive Order imposes a specific, substantive requirement on how these facilities must be managed and defined (i.e., as single-sex spaces based on biological reality).

The effect flows as follows:
1.  **GSA Building Policy:** GSA's Public Buildings Service will be required to develop and implement building management policies that comply with the EO's mandate. This will likely involve new directives on signage, facility access rules, and the designation of single-sex spaces.
2.  **Building Services Contracts:** The Performance Work Statements (PWS) within building services contracts will need to be updated to reflect these new GSA building policies. For example, a janitorial contract might be modified to include specific instructions for servicing and stocking restrooms now strictly defined by biological sex.
3.  **COR Responsibilities:** The COR's role, as detailed in the Desk Guide, is to ensure the contractor performs in accordance with the contract's PWS. If the PWS is updated to include new requirements derived from the EO, the COR's oversight duties will change accordingly.

Therefore, the Desk Guide, in its current form, is insufficient for guiding CORs on how to oversee contractor compliance with new, EO-mandated facility management policies. While the guide is not in direct violation of the EO, it is a subordinate, procedural document that will require updates to support the implementation of higher-level policy changes mandated by the EO.

### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance
To ensure alignment and effective implementation, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Await Agency-Level Guidance:** The first step is to await formal implementation guidance from GSA's Office of General Counsel and the Office of Government-wide Policy, which will interpret the EO's requirements for GSA operations.
2.  **Review and Identify Gaps:** Conduct a full review of the COR Desk Guide and associated templates for building services contracts (e.g., sample PWS). Identify all sections related to facility services, quality assurance, and reporting that would be impacted by new policies on single-sex spaces.
3.  **Develop New Guidance for CORs:** Draft a new section or an addendum for the Desk Guide that provides specific instructions for CORs on how to monitor and verify contractor compliance with EO-related contract requirements. This may include checklists for inspecting facility signage or protocols for addressing public or employee complaints related to facility access.
4.  **Update and Disseminate:** Once agency-level policy is finalized, revise the COR Desk Guide and any related contractual documents. Distribute the updated guide to all PBS contracting and COR personnel and provide training on the new oversight responsibilities.

Final Determination: Affected",Affected,"1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:** The policy is the ""COR Desk Guide | Building Services Contracts"" issued by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). Its domain is federal procurement and contract administration. Specifically, it provides procedural guidance to Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs) who manage contracts for services related to the operation and maintenance of federal buildings, such as janitorial, security, or maintenance services.

2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order (EO) is ""Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government."" Its domain is federal civil rights and workforce policy, with a specific focus on gender identity. The EO aims ","Final Decision: [Affected]

Full Justification:
1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:** The policy is the ""COR Desk Guide | Building Services Contracts"" issued by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). Its domain is federal procurement and contract administration. Specifically, it provides procedural guidance to Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs) who manage contracts for services related to the operation and maintenance of federal buildings, such as janitorial, security, or maintenance services.

2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order (EO) is ""Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government."" Its domain is federal civil rights and workforce policy, with a specific focus on gender identity. The EO aims to establish a government-wide policy based on biological sex and regulate access to sex-segregated spaces and facilities within the federal government.

3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** The executive order has a clear, albeit indirect, impact on the policy. The policy guide governs contracts for services within federal buildings. The executive order sets new rules for the use of facilities *within those same buildings*. While the EO does not directly amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation or the GSA's core contracting procedures, it fundamentally alters the operational environment and requirements for federal facilities. These new requirements would necessarily affect the scope of work for building services contracts. For example, regulations stemming from this EO could mandate changes to signage, restroom/locker room designations, or specific maintenance protocols for single-sex spaces. A COR using this Desk Guide would need to ensure that their contractor's performance aligns with these new federal facility policies. Therefore, the guide's instructions on contract administration would need to be applied in the context of the EO's mandates, potentially requiring addendums to the guide or updates to contract statements of work.

4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:** The link is established by connecting the policy's subject matter with the EO's specific provisions.
    *   **Policy Subject**: ""Building Services Contracts"" inherently deals with the physical spaces in federal buildings.
    *   **EO Text**: The EO explicitly mentions its application to federal spaces, specifically ""intimate single-sex spaces"" and ""women’s workplace showers.""
    Since the GSA's Building Services Contracts are used to clean, maintain, and service these exact spaces, any government-wide order that redefines the rules for these spaces directly impacts the services performed under those contracts.

5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** The impact is indirect rather than direct. The EO will not change the section of the guide that explains how to approve an invoice. However, it will impact the substance of the work being performed and overseen. A COR is responsible for ensuring contract performance meets all government requirements. When the government's requirements for its own facilities change due to an EO, the COR's responsibilities, and thus the practical application of the Desk Guide, are affected. The guide itself may need to be updated to reflect these new compliance considerations for building service contracts. The initial ""Affected"" flag is therefore correct because the policy and the EO govern overlapping spheres of federal operations—one at the procedural contract level and the other at the high-level facility use policy level.",10,"*   **Reasoning vs. Description:** The SME justification provides a direct, causal reasoning for its conclusion (the EO's mandate to revise documents directly impacts the COR guide).

Key Differences:
*   **Reasoning vs. Description:** The SME justification provides a direct, causal reasoning for its conclusion (the EO's mandate to revise documents directly impacts the COR guide). The model's response is purely descriptive; it defines the domain of the policy and the EO but never explains how they interact or why one would affect the other.
*   **Actionable Conclusion:** The SME's justification logically leads to the conclusion that the policy is ""substantively affected."" The model provides no analysis or conclusion, leaving the reader to infer the connection.
*   **Specificity of Impact:** The SME pinpoints the exact mechanism of the EO's impact: the ""explicit mandate to revise federal documentation and remove gender identity references."" The model does not identify any specific provision or impact.

Commentary:
The model's justification fails to perform the core task of providing a reason for the compliance determination. It successfully identifies and summarizes the policy and the executive order, which is a useful preliminary step, but it does not connect them to form a logical argument. It answers ""what are these two things?"" but not ""why does this EO affect this policy?""

The SME's justification, in contrast, is an excellent example of concise, effective policy analysis. It establishes a direct cause-and-effect relationship, citing a specific mandate in the EO and explaining its direct consequence on the policy document. The model's reasoning is incomplete and descriptive, whereas the SME's is analytical and conclusive."

Purpose. Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single- sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women s domestic abuse shelters to women s workplace showers. This is wrong. Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system. Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself. This unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts. Invalidating the true and biological category of  woman  improperly trans- forms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept. Accordingly, my Administration will defend women s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male. Sec. 2. Policy and Definitions. It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Under my direc- tion, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpre- tation of and application of Federal law and administration policy: (a)  Sex  shall refer to an individual s immutable biological classification as either male or female.  Sex  is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of  gender identity.  (b)  Women  or  woman  and  girls  or  girl  shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively. (c)  Men  or  man  and  boys  or  boy  shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively. (d)  Female  means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell. (e)  Male  means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that pro- duces the small reproductive cell. (f)  Gender ideology  replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true.

Gender ideology is internally incon- sistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body. (g)  Gender identity  reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex. Sec. 3. Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men. (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order. (b) Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. Each agency should therefore give the terms  sex ,  male ,  female ,  men ,  women ,  boys  and  girls  the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications. (c) When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term  sex  and not  gender  in all applicable Federal policies and documents. (d) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees  sex, as defined by section 2 of this order. (e) Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, com- munications, or other internal and external messages that promote or other- wise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. Agency forms that require an individual s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity. Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology. (f) The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single- sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act. This position is legally untenable and has harmed women. The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities. In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent. (g) Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology. Sec. 4. Privacy in Intimate Spaces. (a) The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that males are not detained in women s prisons or housed in women s detention centers, including through amend- ment, as necessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act.

(c) The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate s appearance to that of the opposite sex. (d) Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity. Sec. 5. Protecting Rights. The Attorney General shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In accordance with that guidance, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the General Counsel and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act shall prioritize inves- tigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified. Sec. 6. Bill Text. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs shall present to the President proposed bill text to codify the definitions in this order. Sec. 7.

1. Policy Summary:
The GSA Environmental Justice Intragovernmental Committee Charter establishes an Environmental Justice Committee (EJC) to coordinate and advance environmental justice activities within GSA. The committee's key objectives include developing EJ priorities, overseeing EJ actions, and improving EJ initiatives across GSA business lines.

2. Executive Order Summary:
Executive Order 14168 focuses on defining biological sex and gender, requiring federal agencies to:
- Use strict biological definitions of sex
- Remove gender ideology from federal policies and communications
- Ensure sex-based distinctions in federal documents and programs
- Restrict gender identity considerations in federal activities

3. Applicability Assessment:
The executive order does NOT directly impact the Environmental Justice Committee Charter. The policy is focused on environmental justice activities and does not involve gender identity or related policy discussions. The charter's objectives, membership, and functions remain unchanged by this executive order.

Key reasons for non-applicability:
- The EJ Committee Charter is focused on environmental policy
- No gender-related terminology or policy exists in the original document
- The charter's objectives are purely environmental and administrative

4. Compliance Recommendations:
While no direct changes are required, the GSA may want to:
- Conduct a brief review to ensure no unintended gender-related language exists in committee communications
- Ensure any future committee documents use terminology consistent with the new executive order's definitions
- Maintain the current charter's focus on environmental justice objectives

Conclusion: No substantive changes to the Environmental Justice Committee Charter are necessary based on this executive order.",Not affected,Not Affected,"The Executive Order 14168 targets gender policy definitions and administrative practices, while the Environmental Justice Committee Charter addresses environmental coordination objectives, creating no meaningful intersection or required policy modifications.",Not Affected,"**TO:** GSA Leadership
**FROM:** GSA Policy Analysis Division
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Analysis of Executive Order 14168 Impact on the GSA Environmental Justice Intragovernmental Committee Charter

This memorandum provides an analysis of Executive Order 14168 and its potential effect on the GSA Environmental Justice Intragovernmental Committee Charter.

### 1. Summary of Policy Text
The ""GSA Environmental Justice Intragovernmental Committee Charter"" is a foundational document that establishes a new Environmental Justice Committee (EJC) within the GSA. The purpose of the EJC is to manage and coordinate GSA's environmental justice activities. Its core responsibilities include providing policy advice to GSA leadership, developing an Environmental Justice Strategic Plan, and ensuring the implementation of planned activities. The charter explicitly grounds its authority in laws and executive orders related to civil rights and environmental justice for minority and low-income populations.

### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text
Executive Order 14168, ""Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,"" directs all federal agencies to base their policies on the ""immutable biological reality of sex."" It mandates the use of clear language that recognizes women as biologically female and men as biologically male. The E.O.'s stated purpose is to protect women's rights, safety, and single-sex spaces and activities by rejecting subjective, identity-based concepts of sex in federal policy and law.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability
Executive Order 14168 does not directly apply to or affect the text of the GSA Environmental Justice Intragovernmental Committee Charter. The analysis is based on the following points:

*   **Divergent Subject Matter:** The GSA Charter is concerned with the procedural establishment of a committee and the substantive topic of environmental justice, which it links to ""minority populations and low-income populations."" The Executive Order is narrowly focused on the definition of sex and gender for the purposes of federal policymaking. The two documents do not address the same core issues.
*   **Absence of Targeted Language:** The GSA Charter does not contain any of the terms or concepts that E.O. 14168 seeks to define or regulate. The charter does not use the words ""woman,"" ""man,"" ""sex,"" ""gender,"" or ""gender identity."" Therefore, there is no language in the charter that conflicts with the E.O.'s directives.
*   **Scope of Impact:** The charter establishes the *structure* for developing and implementing policy (the EJC). It does not, in itself, constitute the final substantive policy. While the charter is unaffected, the E.O. would apply to the *future work products* of the EJC. For instance, if the Environmental Justice Strategic Plan developed by the committee were to include analysis or policies related to sex-based environmental health disparities, that plan would be required to adhere to the definitions and principles set forth in E.O. 14168.

In summary, the charter itself, as a foundational and administrative document, remains compliant and requires no modification. The E.O.'s impact is prospective, applying to the future substantive work of the committee it creates, not the document creating it.

### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance
While the policy document itself is not affected, proactive steps should be taken to ensure future compliance of the committee's work.

1.  **No Revisions Required:** The GSA Environmental Justice Intragovernmental Committee Charter does not need to be amended.
2.  **Inform the Committee:** The newly established Environmental Justice Committee (EJC) must be formally advised of the requirements of E.O. 14168.
3.  **Guidance for Future Work:** The EJC should be directed to ensure that all future deliverables, including research, policy recommendations, and the GSA Environmental Justice Strategic Plan, utilize language and definitions concerning sex and gender that are fully compliant with E.O. 14168.

Final Determination: [Not Affected]",Not Affected,"1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:**
    The policy, ""Environmental Justice Committee Charter,"" is administrative and procedural in nature. Its domain is **Environmental Justice (EJ)** and government administration. The charter's purpose is to establish an Environmental Justice Committee (EJC) within the General Services Administration (GSA) to ""better manage and coordinate environmental justice (EJ) activities."" The focus is explicitly on addressing issues in ""Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,"" as mandated by foundational laws and executive orders like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and E.O. 12898.

2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:**
    The executive order, E.O. 14168, ""Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restor","Final Decision: Not Affected

Full Justification:
1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:**
    The policy, ""Environmental Justice Committee Charter,"" is administrative and procedural in nature. Its domain is **Environmental Justice (EJ)** and government administration. The charter's purpose is to establish an Environmental Justice Committee (EJC) within the General Services Administration (GSA) to ""better manage and coordinate environmental justice (EJ) activities."" The focus is explicitly on addressing issues in ""Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,"" as mandated by foundational laws and executive orders like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and E.O. 12898.

2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:**
    The executive order, E.O. 14168, ""Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,"" operates in the domain of **civil rights, gender identity, and federal definitions of sex**. Its stated purpose is to establish a federal policy that defines sex based on biological reality and to regulate access to ""intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women.""

3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:**
    There is **no direct or meaningful indirect impact** of the executive order on the policy charter. The two documents address entirely separate and non-overlapping subject areas.
    *   **Direct Impact:** The EO does not amend, rescind, or contradict any part of the GSA's Environmental Justice Committee Charter. The EO is about the definition of sex and gender, while the policy is about the formation of a committee to handle environmental issues affecting communities defined by race and income. The legal authorities cited in the charter (E.O. 12898, E.O. 14008, etc.) are not affected by E.O. 14168.
    *   **Indirect Impact:** A potential indirect impact is too speculative to be considered relevant. One could argue that if the EJC's future work involved analyzing environmental impacts on ""women,"" the new EO would dictate how that demographic is defined. However, this does not affect the policy itself, which is the *charter* that establishes the committee's existence and broad purpose. The charter's text and function remain completely intact regardless of how other federal policies define specific demographic groups.

4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:**
    *   **Policy Language:** The charter's focus is on ""environmental justice (EJ) activities in... Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations."" This language clearly delineates its scope to matters of race, income, and environmental policy.
    *   **EO Language:** The EO's focus is on the ""biological reality of sex,"" efforts to ""permit men to self-identify as women,"" and access to ""intimate single-sex spaces."" This language confines its application to federal policies directly related to gender identity and sex-based classifications.
    *   The complete lack of shared terminology or subject matter between the two documents demonstrates their independence from one another.

5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:**
    The primary nuance considered was the potential for future work by the committee, rather than the charter itself, to be influenced by the EO. However, the task is to assess the EO's relevance to the *policy provided*, which is the charter. The charter's function is to create a committee; it is not a substantive policy on demographics. The EO does not prevent the committee from being formed or from carrying out its core mission related to environmental justice for minority and low-income groups. Therefore, the charter is not affected. The initial ""Not Affected"" flag is correct.",95,"*   **Level of Detail:** The model provides a more detailed, structured analysis of the policy's specific domain (Environmental Justice), purpose (coordination), and target populations (Minority and Low-Income), whereas the SME provides a high-level summary.
*   **Explicit Conclusio",The model's reasoning is excellent and aligns almost perfectly with the SME's justification. It correctly identifies that the policy is focused on Environmental Justice for specific populations and the Executive Order is focused on gender policy. The model's justification is more thoroug,"Similarity Score: 95

Key Differences:
*   **Level of Detail:** The model provides a more detailed, structured analysis of the policy's specific domain (Environmental Justice), purpose (coordination), and target populations (Minority and Low-Income), whereas the SME provides a high-level summary.
*   **Explicit Conclusion:** The SME explicitly states the conclusion (""no meaningful intersection or required policy modifications""), while the model's justification implies this conclusion by clearly laying out the distinct and unrelated domains of the two documents.

Commentary:
The model's reasoning is excellent and aligns almost perfectly with the SME's justification. It correctly identifies that the policy is focused on Environmental Justice for specific populations and the Executive Order is focused on gender policy. The model's justification is more thorough than the SME's, providing specific details from the policy charter that strengthen the argument. While it doesn't state the final conclusion as explicitly as the SME, the reasoning laid out makes that conclusion self-evident. The model's response is a high-quality, well-supported analysis."
