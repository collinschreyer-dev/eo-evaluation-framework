Purpose The purpose of this Procurement Instructional Bulletin (PIB) is to outline the guidelines for implementation and use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool. 2. Background The Skill Enhancement & Employee Development (SEED) program was created to provide the 1102 contract specialist community with a solid foundation, minimize acquisition skill gaps, and increase the overall knowledge and skills of the acquisition workforce. As part of SEED, the PATH tool was developed to give those in the 1102 acquisition community with little to no contracting knowledge a tool to learn and test their knowledge using scenario based exercises. The tool consists of various exercises categorized into the following modules: Pre-Award, Award, Post-Award, and Other. 3. Effective Date This PIB is effective on the date signed. The exercises that make up the training tool will be updated, as needed, to address any regulatory changes or Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) policy guidance 1800 F Street, NW Washington, DC 20405-0002 www.gsa.gov DocuSign Envelope ID: 3DF787F3-F9CB-4240-B6F6-E46C4D13456610/28/2022 revisions. 4. Cancellation Date This PIB will remain in effect until canceled. 5. Affected or Canceled Policies None. 6. Applicability This PIB applies to all Public Buildings Service (PBS) 1102s, including interns hired under the PBS Acquisition Intern Program. Use of the PATH tool is mandatory for new employees at the GS-09 level and below who are hired on or after the effective date of this tool. The tool is optional for those employees above the GS-09 level. 7. Exceptions The requirements of this PIB will not be applicable to employees who are participating under the Emerging Leaders Program (ELP), until they are converted to the 1102 series. 8. Instructions and Procedures Exercises & Answer Keys The exercises are broken into four modules: Pre-award, Award, Post-Award, and Other. There are two documents for each topic: the exercise and answer key. Links to all of the documents can be found on Attachment 1 - PATH Tool Table of Contents. Users should complete the exercises in chronological order. Some exercises have a service and construction type scenario. In those cases, users can elect to complete one or both exercises. The users will access the exercise, read the scenario, if one is included, and use the policy and guidance references to answer the questions. Only the regional supervisors will have access to the answer key documents. Upon completion of each exercise, users must work with their supervisor, or designee, to review their responses and compare them to the answer key. This will help ensure that users understand the general concepts of the exercise topic. 2 DocuSign Envelope ID: 3DF787F3-F9CB-4240-B6F6-E46C4D134566 New employees will be expected to complete the entire tool within 18 months of their start date. At a minimum, the first module (Pre-Award) is to be completed within the first year. FAI CSOD & CLPs Upon completion of all exercises in a module, users are to ensure that their completion is indicated in FAI Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD). To do this, supervisors are to complete the survey form linked as Attachment 2 - PATH Tool Supervisor Confirmation of Completion. Upon receipt, OAM will update FAI CSOD. This must be done for completion of each module. OAM will use this information to track completion of the tool. This process will also assist to provide continuous learning points (CLPs) to users who are eligible to receive them. 9.

Purpose and Policy. The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government. The injection of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  (DEI) into our institutions has corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy. Orders to open the borders have endangered the American people and dissolved Federal, State, and local resources that should be used to benefit the American people. Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation. To commence the policies that will make our Nation united, fair, safe, and prosperous again, it is the policy of the United States to restore common sense to the Federal Government and unleash the potential of the American citizen. The revocations within this order will be the first of many steps the United States Federal Government will take to repair our institutions and our economy. Sec. 2. Revocation of Orders and Actions. The following executive actions are hereby revoked: (a) Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Govern- ment).

Policy Summary (PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 23-01):\n- Establishes mandatory use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool\n- Applies to Public Buildings Service (PBS) contract specialists (1102 series)\n- Focuses on skill enhancement and employee development for acquisition workforce\n- Mandatory for new employees at GS-09 level and below\n- Requires completion of training modules within 18 months of start date\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\n- Rescinds numerous previous executive orders related to various federal policies\n- Focuses on removing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives\n- Directs agency heads to end implementation of what it terms \"unlawful and radical DEI ideology\"\n- Requires review of previous administrative actions\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\n- The executive order does NOT directly impact the PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin\n- The PATH tool is a professional training program focused on acquisition skills\n- The policy does not appear to contain DEI-specific language or components that would trigger the executive order's rescission requirements\n\n4. Recommended Next Steps:\n- No immediate action required for this specific policy\n- Continue normal implementation of the PATH tool training program\n- Maintain standard documentation and tracking of employee training completions\n- Consult with GSA legal counsel if any uncertainty remains about policy compliance\n\nRecommendation: Continue current policy implementation without modifications.\n\nNote: This analysis is based on a careful review of the documents and represents a professional, objective assessment of potential impacts.

      "phase1_response": "Of course. As a policy analyst for the General Services Administration, I can provide an analysis of the provided documents.\n\nHere is a summary of my findings.\n\n***\n\n**TO:** GSA Leadership\n**FROM:** GSA Policy Analyst\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n**SUBJECT:** Analysis of Executive Order 14148 Impact on PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 23-01 (Mandatory Use of PATH Tool)\n\n### 1. Summary of Policy Text (PIB 23-01)\nThe policy, Procurement Instructional Bulletin (PIB) 23-01, establishes the mandatory use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool for all new GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) employees in the 1102 contract specialist series at the GS-09 level and below. The PATH tool is part of the broader Skill Enhancement & Employee Development (SEED) program and is designed to provide foundational knowledge in government contracting through scenario-based exercises. The training modules cover the full acquisition lifecycle: Pre-Award, Award, and Post-Award. The policy is operational and focuses on ensuring a baseline level of technical competence for junior acquisition professionals.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text (EO 14148)\nExecutive Order 14148, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions,\" revokes several executive orders from the previous administration. The stated purpose is to remove policies related to \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI), immigration, and \"climate extremism,\" which the order describes as harmful. Specifically, the EO revokes E.O. 13985 (\"Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities\"), among others. The order\u2019s focus is on rescinding high-level, government-wide policy directives and the principles they established.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\nThis executive order **does not directly apply to or invalidate** the policy outlined in PIB 23-01. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n*   **Different Scopes:** The PIB is a procedural, internal GSA policy focused on technical skills training for a specific job series (1102 Contract Specialist). Its purpose is to ensure employee competency in the mechanics of federal procurement. The Executive Order, conversely, targets broad, government-wide policy frameworks, particularly those related to DEI, that influence the goals and principles of federal actions.\n*   **No Direct Linkage:** PIB 23-01 and the PATH tool it mandates are not established by or derived from any of the Executive Orders revoked by EO 14148. The SEED program and PATH tool are internal GSA initiatives aimed at professional development and closing skill gaps, a standard function of a federal agency. The policy text contains no language related to DEI, racial equity, or underserved communities.\n*   **Content vs. Mandate:** The Executive Order could potentially influence the *content* of future federal acquisition regulations (e.g., the FAR), which in turn could necessitate updates to the training scenarios within the PATH tool. For example, if regulations derived from E.O. 13985 are changed, a training scenario based on those specific regulations would need to be revised. However, this does not affect the validity of the PIB itself, which is the mandate *to use the tool* for training. The PIB wisely anticipates this by stating, \"The exercises that make up the training tool will be updated, as needed, to address any regulatory changes.\"\n\nIn summary, the policy mandating the use of a skills-based training tool is unaffected. The potential impact is secondary, relating only to the specific content of the training exercises, which are designed to be updated as regulations change.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\nWhile the policy itself is not affected and requires no revision, prudent action should be taken to ensure the content of the training tool remains compliant with the new federal policy landscape.\n\n1.  **No Action Required for PIB 23-01:** The bulletin can remain in effect as written.\n2.  **Content Review of the PATH Tool:** The Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), as the responsible office, should initiate a review of the scenarios and exercises within all PATH modules (Pre-Award, Award, Post-Award, Other).\n3.  **Identify and Update Content:** The review should identify any training content, examples, or scenarios that are based specifically on policies, programs, or guidance originating from the now-revoked Executive Order 13985. Any such content should be updated to reflect current regulations and policy. This action falls within the existing process described in Section 3 of the PIB.\n\nFinal Determination: Not Affected",

      "phase2_justification": "1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:** The policy, \"PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 23-01,\" falls within the domain of **federal acquisition workforce training and professional development**.

Its specific purpose is to mandate the use of the \"Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH)\" tool for the 1102 contract specialist community within the General Services Administration (GSA). The goal is to standardize training, enhance skills, and close knowledge gaps in federal procurement.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions,\" is a broad, government-wide directive aimed at **reversing specific policy priorities of the previous administration**. It explicitly targets and seeks to eliminate policies, practices, and programs related to \"diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI),\" certain immigration policies, and \"climate extremism.\" Its central focus is on federal personnel and management practices that it claims have replaced merit with \"a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy.\"\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** While there is no direct, explicit contradiction between the texts, the executive order has a clear **indirect impact** on the policy. The policy mandates a training program (PATH) in the field of federal procurement. Federal procurement is a domain heavily intertwined with regulations and goals that are often categorized under the umbrella of DEI, such as programs for small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and other set-asides aimed at promoting equity in government contracting.\n\n    The executive order's stated intent to remove the \"injection of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' (DEI) into our institutions\" would almost certainly trigger a review of all training materials for federal acquisition professionals. The content of the PATH tool, which this policy mandates, would be scrutinized to ensure it aligns with the new administration's anti-DEI stance. Any training modules, scenarios, or guidance related to equitable procurement or supplier diversity would be subject to revision or removal. Because the policy's sole function is to enforce the use of this tool, any substantive changes to the tool's content directly affect the implementation and substance of the policy itself.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:**\n    *   **Policy Text:** The policy supports the \"Skill Enhancement & Employee Development (SEED) program\" and mandates the \"PATH tool\" to give the \"1102 acquisition community... a tool to learn and test their knowledge.\" This establishes a mandatory training regime in the procurement field.\n    *   **EO Text:** The order targets the \"injection of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' (DEI) into our institutions\" which it claims has \"corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy.\"\n    *   **The Link:** The EO's sweeping language against DEI \"practices... embedded within every agency\" applies directly to training programs that instruct federal employees on how to implement procurement laws. Since federal procurement law contains provisions that could be interpreted by the new administration as DEI-related, the training content is a clear target for review under the EO. Therefore, the policy mandating the training is affected.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** The initial \"Not Affected\" flag likely resulted from a narrow reading of the policy text, which, on its face, is neutral and focuses only on skills and knowledge. However, this assessment fails to consider the context of the subject matter. A policy does not have to explicitly mention \"DEI\" to be affected by an order that targets DEI. By mandating a program in a field where DEI principles are actively practiced (federal contracting), the policy's implementation becomes contingent on the EOs directives. The bulletin itself might not be rescinded, but the program it mandates will be reviewed and likely altered, thus affecting the policy's execution and intent.",

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (P.L. 117-164, the  Act ), signed by the President on December 29, 2022, only appropriated $1,470,089,000 of New Obligational Authority (NOA) in support of this request. At this time, GSA has received a 30 day auto- allotment of funds in Pegasys and all Continuing Resolution guidance is now lifted. 30 day allowances have been processed for the Basic R&A program, however allowances for the prospectus projects will not be processed until the full year apportionment is received from OMB and projects have both House and Senate approval (see FY 2023 Prospectus Updates section below for project details). Central Office will work with regions who may have any expiring bids prior to January 31st. Notification will be sent upon receipt of the full year apportionment.

Funding under this program was provided for the U.S. Courthouses in Hartford, CT, Fort Lauderdale, FL, Chattanooga, TN, the DHS Consolidation at St. Elizabeths, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Lease Purchase Option, the Southeast Federal Center Remediation, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters Consolidation. Regarding the U.S. Courthouses: - Since Hartford and Chattanooga were partially funded in FY 2021 and FY 2022, prospectuses in support of these projects were transmitted to GSA s Authorizing Committees, and we have received both House and Senate approvals. - Considering Fort Lauderdale previously received FY 2018 appropriations, both House and Senate FY 2018 prospectus approvals, and original scope has not changed, GSA may proceed awarding the additional FY 2023 funding to address cost escalation due to time and market conditions associated with the FY 2018 prospectus scope. FY 2023 Capital Investment Program Status Update and Execution Guidance Page 2 DocuSign Envelope ID: B9DBD55F-BB2F-499B-89B5-A6FB6F03BEE1 NOTE: In FY 2023, Congress increased our internal BA51 escalation prospectus authority from 10% up to 20%. Increasing our escalation authority affords GSA more internal flexibility to cover cost increases for these BA51 projects without first obtaining external OMB and Congressional approval. This 20% increased threshold applies only to the new construction and remediation project funding listed in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. All previous New Construction funding is still subject to the previous 10% internal escalation threshold. Major Repairs and Alterations Program Appropriations The $662,280,000 appropriated for Major Repairs and Alterations (Major R&A) was $1,089,590,000 less than the requested amount of $1,751,870,000. Unlike previous years, the Act provided specific line item appropriations for each of our Major R&A Programs. - The Basic Repairs and Alterations (BA54) program was appropriated at our full requested amount of $398,797,000. - The $244,783,000 appropriated for Major R&A (BA55) projects was $943,290,000 less than the requested amount of $1,188,073,000. - The $18,700,000 appropriated for Special Emphasis (BA55) programs was $146,300,000 less than the requested amount of $165,000,000.

Increasing our escalation authority affords GSA more internal flexibility to cover cost increases for BA55 projects without first obtaining external OMB and Congressional approval. Furthermore, since the Act s provision specifically states \"funds made available in this or any previous Act....\", the 20% increased threshold also applies to previous years BA55 prospectus projects and funding. FY 2023 Prospectus Updates Projects are unable to move forward unless both House and Senate authorizing committee prospectus approval is received. Updates on the FY 2023 Capital Investment Program prospectus approvals can be found at the FY 2023 Capital Investment Program At a Glance1, and updates and copies of the prospectuses and Committee Resolutions can be found on the D2D Prospectus Pipeline and the Capital Investment and Leasing Program Prospectus Library on gsa.gov. - Green signifies full prospectus approval received. Regions MAY proceed with full procurement activities and make awards. - Yellow signifies outstanding approval is needed. Regions MAY proceed with limited pre-procurement activities (activities prior to the \"public facing\" activities such as the advertisement (RFQ) for all FY23 projects (such as developing the actual Scope of Work that will be used in the Request For Qualifications (RFQ) and then the Request for Proposal (RFP); developing Source Selection plan and scoring criteria; assembling the source selection team, reaching a decision on who to select finalizing the CapPMP, Acquisition Plan, etc....). Regions MAY NOT make an award until notified from Central Office that both House and Senate authorizing committee prospectus approval have been received. 1 Snapshot as of 1/12/2023 FY 2023 Capital Investment Program Status Update and Execution Guidance Page 4 DocuSign Envelope ID: B9DBD55F-BB2F-499B-89B5-A6FB6F03BEE1 Hurricane Ian Supplemental Appropriation Title V of the FY 2023 Act provided an additional amount to be deposited in the  Federal Buildings Fund , $36,788,390, to remain available until expended, for necessary expenses related to the consequences of Hurricane Ian, for repair and alteration of buildings under the jurisdiction, custody and control of the Administrator of General Services, and real property management and related activities not otherwise provided for: Provided, That the amount provided under this heading in this Act may be used to reimburse the Fund for obligations incurred for this purpose prior to the date of the enactment of this Act.

Purpose. Federal regulations should not predetermine economic winners and losers. Yet some regulations operate to exclude new market entrants. Regulations that reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innova- tion as well as the benefits they create for American consumers should be eliminated. This order commences the process for eliminating anti-com- petitive regulations to revitalize the American economy. Sec. 2. Definitions. (a)  Agency  has the meaning given to it in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code, except that it does not include the Executive Office of the President or any components thereof. (b)  Agency head  means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director, unless otherwise specified in this order. Sec. 3. Rescinding Anti-Competitive Regulations. (a) Agency heads shall, in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (Chair- man) and the Attorney General, complete a review of all regulations subject to their rulemaking authority and identify those that: (i) create, or facilitate the creation of, de facto or de jure monopolies; (ii) create unnecessary barriers to entry for new market participants; (iii) limit competition between competing entities or have the effect of limiting competition between competing entities; (iv) create or facilitate licensure or accreditation requirements that unduly limit competition; (v) unnecessarily burden the agency s procurement processes, thereby lim- iting companies  ability to compete for procurements; or (vi) otherwise impose anti-competitive restraints or distortions on the oper- ation of the free market. (b) Within 70 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall each provide to the Chairman and the Attorney General a list of regulations identified by the categories specified in subsection (a) of this section. Agency heads shall also include a recommendation as to whether each of the listed regulations warrants rescission or modification in light of its anti-competitive effects. For recommended modifications, agency heads shall briefly specify what modification is appropriate. For regulations that are anti-competitive by design, agency heads shall provide a justification for their anti-competitive effects if the agency head is not proposing rescission or modification. (c) In conducting the review required by subsection (a) of this section, agency heads shall prioritize review of those rules that satisfy the definition of  significant regulatory action  in Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended. (d) Within 10 days of the date of this order, the Chairman shall issue a request for information (RFI) that seeks public input on the identification of regulations that fall within the categories specified in subsection (a) of this section, as well as comments explaining the proposed classifications. The request shall remain open for 40 days.

(e) Within 90 days of receipt of the agency lists specified in subsection (b) of this section, the Chairman, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the relevant agency heads, shall provide to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) a consolidated list of regulations that warrant rescission or modification in light of their anti-competitive effects, along with rec- ommended modifications. The Chairman may include on the consolidated list regulations not originally included on an agency list if such regulations fall within at least one of the categories outlined in subsections (a)(i)  (vi) of this section. (f) Upon receipt of the consolidated list described in subsection (e) of this section, the OMB Director, through the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, shall consult with the Chairman, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the relevant agency heads to decide whether to incorporate the proposed rescissions or modifications into the Unified Regulatory Agenda developed pursuant to Executive Order 14219 of February 19, 2025 (Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President s  Department of Government Efficiency  Deregulatory Initiative). Sec. 4. General Provisions.

      "Summary": "Policy Analysis Summary\n\n1. Policy Text Summary:\nThe GSA memorandum dated January 13, 2023, provides guidance on the Fiscal Year 2023 Capital Investment Program. Key points include:\n- Total Capital Budget of $2,159,893,000\n- Increased escalation authority from 10% to 20% for New Construction and Acquisition (BA51) and Major Repairs and Alterations (BA55) projects\n- Detailed funding allocations for various construction and renovation projects\n- Guidance on project procurement and approval processes\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nExecutive Order 14267 (April 9, 2025) aims to:\n- Reduce anti-competitive regulatory barriers\n- Require agencies to review and identify regulations that:\n  a) Create monopolies\n  b) Limit market competition\n  c) Create unnecessary entry barriers\n  d) Impose anti-competitive restraints\n- Mandate a comprehensive review of existing regulations\n- Establish a process for potential rescission or modification of anti-competitive regulations\n\n3. Applicability of Executive Order:\nThe executive order DOES apply to this GSA policy for the following reasons:\n- The policy involves procurement and investment processes\n- The escalation authority and project approval mechanisms could potentially be viewed as creating regulatory barriers\n- The order specifically targets regulations that might limit competition in government processes\n\n4. Recommended Next Steps for Compliance:\na) Conduct a thorough review of the Capital Investment Program guidelines\nb) Assess how current escalation authorities and project approval processes might create market entry barriers\nc) Prepare documentation justifying the current regulatory approach\nd) Be prepared to provide detailed explanations of how current processes:\n   - Do not unduly limit market competition\n   - Ensure fair and open procurement\n   - Provide equal opportunities for different market participants\ne) Collaborate with the Federal Trade Commission and Attorney General's office to validate the current regulatory approach\nf) Be ready to modify guidelines if anti-competitive elements are identified\n\nRecommendation: While the current policy appears to provide flexibility (20% escalation authority), a proactive review should be conducted to ensure full compliance with the executive order's intent of promoting market competition.",

      "phase1_response": "TO: GSA Leadership\nFROM: GSA Policy Analyst\nDATE: October 26, 2023\nSUBJECT: Analysis of Executive Order 14267's Impact on the FY 2023 Capital Investment Program Execution Guidance Memorandum\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of Executive Order 14267, \"Reducing Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers,\" and its effect on the GSA internal policy memorandum titled \"Increased 20% Escalation Authority Update FY 2023 Capital Investment Program Execution Guidance.\"\n\n### 1. Summary of the Policy Text\n\nThe GSA policy document is an internal memorandum dated January 13, 2023. It provides financial and execution guidance to GSA regional directors regarding the FY 2023 Capital Investment Program. The memo details the discrepancy between the President's Budget Request ($2.16B) and the final appropriated amount from Congress ($1.47B). It provides specific instructions on the status of funding allotments, the lifting of Continuing Resolution guidance, and the process for handling project funds, particularly for prospectus projects pending full-year apportionment and congressional approvals. The document is administrative and procedural in nature, focused on internal budget execution and project management based on a specific congressional appropriation.\n\n### 2. Summary of the Executive Order Text\n\nExecutive Order 14267, issued on April 9, 2025, directs federal agencies to eliminate anti-competitive regulations. Its stated purpose is to remove rules that exclude new market entrants, limit competition, and stifle innovation. The order mandates that agency heads review all regulations under their authority and identify those that create monopolies, establish unnecessary barriers to entry, limit competition, impose undue licensure requirements, or unnecessarily burden the agency's procurement processes. The clear intent is to scrutinize public-facing rules that govern how private entities interact with the government and compete in the marketplace.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nThe Executive Order **does not apply** to this specific GSA policy memorandum. The analysis is based on the fundamental distinction between a \"regulation\" as targeted by the Executive Order and an \"internal policy/guidance document\" like the GSA memorandum.\n\n*   **Scope of the Executive Order:** E.O. 14267 is focused on \"regulations.\" In a federal context, this term typically refers to formal rules of general applicability and future effect, issued by an agency to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. These regulations are usually codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and impact the public, private industry, or other external stakeholders. The EO's criteria, such as creating \"barriers to entry for new market participants\" or burdening \"procurement processes,\" clearly target the rules that govern how external companies do business with or are regulated by the government.\n\n*   **Nature of the GSA Policy:** The GSA document in question is not a regulation. It is an internal memorandum providing administrative and budgetary guidance to GSA employees. It does not establish any rules for private companies, set new procurement policies, or create licensure requirements. It is an operational document that communicates the status of congressionally appropriated funds and directs internal GSA components on how to manage these funds for specific, named projects (e.g., U.S. Courthouses). It does not alter the underlying procurement regulations (such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation or the GSA Acquisition Manual) that companies must follow to compete for GSA contracts.\n\nWhile GSA's formal procurement *regulations* would be subject to a review under E.O. 14267 (specifically under Sec. 3(a)(v)), this internal memo on budget execution is not one of those regulations.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nBecause this specific policy document is not affected by the Executive Order, no direct action or modification is required for this memorandum.\n\nHowever, as a general matter of compliance with E.O. 14267, GSA should:\n1.  Initiate a broader, agency-wide review of its formal, public-facing regulations, particularly those codified in the GSA Acquisition Manual (GSAM) and other parts of the CFR under GSA's authority.\n2.  Establish a process, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General as required by the EO, to identify any regulations that may create unnecessary burdens on competition in GSA's procurement processes.\n3.  Report the findings of that comprehensive review as mandated by the Executive Order.\n\nThis specific memorandum would not be part of that review.\n\n---\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",

Its stated purpose is to \"eliminate anti-competitive regulations\" that \"exclude new market entrants\" and \"reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innovation.\" This order directs federal agencies to review and change formal regulations that govern economic activity and impact market competition.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** There is no direct or indirect impact from the executive order on this specific policy memorandum. The policy is an internal directive concerning the management of appropriated funds, while the executive order targets external-facing regulations that shape market behavior.\n    *   **No Direct Impact:** The GSA memorandum does not create, modify, or enforce any market regulations. It is an internal administrative communication about budget execution. The EO, conversely, does not address the internal budgetary or financial management processes of federal agencies.\n    *   **No Indirect Impact:** While the regulations governing how GSA *spends* its capital investment funds (e.g., procurement and contracting rules in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) could potentially be subject to review under this EO, this specific memorandum *is not* one of those regulations. It is a document that executes the budget *within* the existing regulatory framework. It concerns the \"what\" and \"how much\" of funding, not the \"rules\" of competition for that funding.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:**\n    *   **Policy Language:** The policy text is focused entirely on fiscal matters: \"GSA\u2019s FY 2023 Capital totaled $2,159,893,000,\" \"appropriated $1,470,089,000 of New Obligational Authority,\" and \"auto-allotment of funds.\" This confirms its nature as a financial execution document.\n    *   **EO Language:** The EO explicitly targets \"Federal regulations\" and seeks to eliminate those that are \"anti-competitive.\" This focus on \"regulations\" as the object of reform is critical. The GSA document is a \"memorandum,\" not a regulation that binds the public or market participants.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** The primary nuance is the distinction between a policy document and the broader regulatory framework it operates within. One might argue that the *process* of capital investment itself could have competitive implications. However, this specific policy document is not the source of those rules. It is a communication about the allocation of funds *after* they have been appropriated by Congress. The EO is concerned with changing the underlying rules of the game, not with the internal communications about the score. Therefore, this memorandum falls outside the scope of the EO's mandate. The initial \"Not Affected\" flag is accurate.",

Background. Lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American interests should not have access to our Nation s secrets, nor should their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts. My Administration must also take appropriate and nec- essary measures to guard against the actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that arise when the Government funds, engages with, or otherwise devotes resources to law firms and their clients that engage in conduct undermining critical American interests and priorities. I have determined that action is necessary to address the significant risks, egregious conduct, and conflicts of interest associated with Susman Godfrey LLP (Susman). Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections. Susman also funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military through the injection of political and radical ideology, and it supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race. Susman itself engages in unlawful discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race. For example, Susman administers a program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities only to  students of color.  My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimi- nation perpetrated in the name of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec. 2. Security Clearance Review. (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applica- ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Susman, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Susman. The heads of agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec. 3. Contracting. (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Susman and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with Susman or with entities that disclose doing business with Susman under subsection (a) of this section. To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall: VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:25 Apr 14, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\15APE0.SGM 15APE0 0 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l 15616 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 71 / Tuesday, April 15, 2025 / Presidential Documents (i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Susman has been hired to perform any service; and (ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Susman or with entities that do business with Susman effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. Sec. 4. Racial Discrimination. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP). Sec. 5. Personnel. (a) The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Susman when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Susman employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States. (b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Susman, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

      "Summary": "Let me analyze this systematically:\n\n1. Policy Summary:\nThe document is a Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) Desk Guide for Building Services Contracts, providing comprehensive guidance for GSA contract administration, focusing on responsibilities, documentation, inspections, and contract management processes.\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nThe executive order targets Susman Godfrey LLP, alleging discriminatory practices and actions inconsistent with national interests. It mandates:\n- Suspension of security clearances for Susman employees\n- Review and potential termination of government contracts with Susman\n- Limiting Susman employees' access to federal buildings\n- Restricting hiring of Susman employees\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nAfter careful review, this executive order does NOT directly impact the COR Desk Guide policy document. Reasons:\n- The policy is a procedural guide for contract management\n- The executive order specifically targets one law firm (Susman Godfrey)\n- The COR Desk Guide provides general administrative procedures applicable across various contracts\n\n4. Compliance Recommendation:\nWhile no direct action is required, GSA should:\n- Ensure current contracting procedures align with the executive order's broader principles of non-discrimination\n- Review existing contracts for compliance with anti-discrimination standards\n- Update contract language if necessary to reflect current federal guidelines\n- Provide guidance to CORs about potential additional contract review requirements\n\nThe executive order does not necessitate changes to the COR Desk Guide itself, but may require supplemental guidance in contract administration practices.",

      "phase1_response": "TO: GSA Leadership, Public Buildings Service (PBS)\nFROM: GSA Policy Analyst\nDATE: October 26, 2023\nSUBJECT: Analysis of Executive Order 14263 on GSA COR Desk Guide for Building Services\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of Executive Order 14263, \"Addressing Risks From Susman Godfrey,\" and its impact on the GSA COR Desk Guide for Building Services Contracts.\n\n### 1. Summary of Policy Text\n\nThe \"U.S. General Services Administration COR Desk Guide | Building Services Contracts\" is an internal GSA operational document. It serves as a procedural manual for GSA's Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs). The guide outlines the roles, responsibilities, and specific procedures for administering and managing building services contracts within the Public Buildings Service (PBS), covering areas like contract oversight, performance monitoring, and compliance. It is a \"how-to\" guide for GSA personnel managing existing contracts.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text\n\nExecutive Order 14263, issued on April 9, 2025, directs the Executive Branch to cease providing federal funds or contracts to the law firm Susman Godfrey LLP. The order's rationale is based on the administration's determination that the firm engages in activities detrimental to American interests, including undermining the legal and electoral systems, funding groups that harm military effectiveness, and practicing unlawful racial discrimination. The EO effectively prohibits federal agencies from engaging in or continuing contractual relationships with this specific entity.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nYes, this executive order directly applies to and affects the policy and procedures outlined in the GSA COR Desk Guide. While the EO does not amend the text of the Desk Guide itself, it imposes a new, substantive requirement that all GSA contracting personnel, including the CORs who use this guide, must follow.\n\nThe relationship is as follows:\n\n*   **Substantive Prohibition:** The Executive Order creates a government-wide, substantive prohibition against contracting with a specific entity (Susman Godfrey LLP).\n*   **Procedural Implementation:** The COR Desk Guide outlines the procedures for contract administration. The actions of the CORs and Contracting Officers who follow this guide are now governed by this new prohibition. For example, any procedures in the guide related to contractor selection, option year renewals, or processing payments would now have to include a verification step to ensure the contractor is not the prohibited entity.\n*   **Implied Duty:** The guide details the COR's responsibility to ensure contractor compliance with laws and regulations. An Executive Order from the President is a binding directive for the Executive Branch; therefore, ensuring compliance with EO 14263 falls within the scope of a COR's duties.\n\nAlthough it is unlikely that a law firm like Susman Godfrey would hold a \"Building Services\" contract with PBS, the GSA's contracting authority is broad. The prohibition is agency-wide and applies to all types of contracts. Therefore, the procedures used by PBS personnel must be updated to account for this directive. The current Desk Guide is now incomplete as it lacks guidance on how to comply with this specific prohibition.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nTo ensure GSA's PBS contracting operations are in full compliance with EO 14263, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1.  **Immediate Notification:** Issue an immediate bulletin to all PBS Contracting Officers (COs), Contract Specialists, and CORs, informing them of the EO and the prohibition on awarding or funding contracts with Susman Godfrey LLP.\n2.  **System-Wide Vendor Check:** GSA must perform a comprehensive review of all current contracts and vendor databases (including GSA Schedules) to identify if Susman Godfrey LLP is a prime or significant subcontractor on any existing GSA contract vehicle. If found, coordinate immediately with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to determine the appropriate contractual remedies, which may include termination for convenience or cause.\n3.  **Update the COR Desk Guide:** The Desk Guide and other relevant acquisition manuals must be updated. Revisions should include a new section on \"Compliance with Executive Orders and Prohibited Entities Lists,\" specifically referencing EO 14263 and establishing a standard procedure for checking contractor eligibility against such directives during all phases of the contract lifecycle.\n4.  **Incorporate into Checklists:** Add a mandatory check-box item to all relevant contract administration checklists (e.g., pre-award surveys, option year renewals, final payment processing) to verify the contractor is not on a list of prohibited entities established by law or Executive Order.\n5.  **Coordinate with OGC:** Engage GSA's Office of General Counsel to develop standardized language and official implementation guidance for all GSA acquisition personnel.\n\nFinal Determination: [Affected]",

Its focus is on the procedural aspects of managing an existing contract.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:**\n    The executive order, \"Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey,\" operates in the domain of **federal procurement eligibility, ethics, and national security**. It establishes a new government-wide restriction that prohibits federal funds and contracts from being awarded to a specific law firm (and potentially others) deemed to be engaging in activities detrimental to U.S. interests. Its focus is on determining *who* is eligible to receive a federal contract in the first place.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:**\n    The executive order has an **indirect but significant impact** on the policy.\n\n    *   **Direct Impact:** The EO does not directly alter the day-to-day procedures outlined in the COR Desk Guide for managing a building services contract (e.g., how to inspect facilities, approve invoices, or monitor performance). The EO's primary impact is on the pre-award phase, where a Contracting Officer (CO) determines vendor eligibility.\n\n    *   **Indirect Impact:** The policy is part of the GSA's overall federal procurement framework, which is holistically governed by executive orders. The GSA, as a federal agency, is bound to implement EO 14263. This means that all GSA procurement activities, including those for building services, must now comply with this new eligibility restriction. While the COR's guide is a post-award document, the COR is an integral part of the acquisition team. The agency's implementation of the EO may result in updated training, reporting requirements, or new clauses in contracts that the COR would then be responsible for monitoring. Therefore, the regulatory environment in which this policy guide exists and is applied is fundamentally altered by the EO.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:**\n    *   **Policy Language:** The title \"COR Desk Guide | Building Services Contracts\" and the text \"Contract administration for PBS Contracting\" clearly place the document within the federal contracting lifecycle.\n    *   **EO Language:** The EO states that certain entities \"should not have access to our Nation's secrets, nor should their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts.\" A \"Building Services Contract\" is a clear example of a subsidy via \"Federal taxpayer funds or contracts.\" The EO's prohibition directly applies to the type of instrument the policy guide is designed to manage.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:**\n    The primary nuance is the distinction between the pre-award (contractor selection) and post-award (contract administration) phases. One could argue the policy is \"Not Affected\" because a COR only manages a contract after it has been awarded, and the EO is about who can be awarded a contract.\n\n    However, this view is too narrow. The entire procurement system must adapt to the EO. An edge case could arise where a prime contractor for building services subcontracts work to a firm like Susman Godfrey. A COR's administrative duties could include reviewing and monitoring subcontractor arrangements, making the EO's prohibitions directly relevant to their oversight responsibilities in that specific scenario. Because the policy exists within a system that is unequivocally affected by the EO, the policy itself must be flagged as \"Affected\" to ensure compliance and potential future updates.",

It does not provide a valid justification for a compliance determination. The hallucinated title of the executive order is a critical error that demonstrates a failure to engage with the source material."

Background The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (54 U.S.C.   300101 et seq.), Executive Order 11593, Executive Order 12072, Executive Order 13006, and Executive Order 13287 direct all Federal agencies to: a. Administer the cultural properties under their custody and control in a spirit of stewardship, trusteeship and sustainability for future generations; b. Initiate measures necessary to direct their policies, plans and programs in such a way that sites, structures and objects of historical, architectural or archeological significance under Federal jurisdiction, custody and control are preserved, restored and maintained for the inspiration and benefit of the people; c. Establish programs for the identification, evaluation, protection, and nomination to the National Register of Historic Places of historic properties under agency custody or control; d. Initiate procedures to promote the use of historic properties available to the agency, encourage location of Federal agencies in historic buildings and historic districts in central business areas, and overcome barriers to the use of historic properties; e. Exercise caution during the interim period until inventories and evaluations required by subsection 3.c, above, are completed so that any federally owned property that might qualify for nomination is not inadvertently transferred, sold, demolished, or substantially altered without the benefit of appropriate consideration and procedures for external review and public participation provided under Federal law. f. Initiate measures and procedures to provide for the continued utility, appropriate care and enhanced sustainability of federally owned historic properties and non-federally owned historic properties that agencies have an opportunity to lease or acquire, in accordance with the professional standards prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior; and g. Establish procedures to monitor and report on the condition and use of historic properties under agency jurisdiction, custody and control, including archeological resources associated with Federal construction projects. Applicability This order applies to all GSA programs, activities and actions that could affect historic and cultural properties.

GSA also is responsible for providing space for the Federal Government in non-Federal properties and for constructing new Federal buildings, as agency space needs change. b. GSA manages both real property, such as Federal buildings, and personal property, such as custom-designed furnishings, fine arts objects, vessels of cultural significance, underwater artifacts, and archeological resources. c. Many properties under GSA's jurisdiction, custody or control are listed in or are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (National Register) and many other properties are potentially eligible for listing in the National Register. d. GSA has a responsibility in the search for new space for its customer agencies to give priority to the use of historic buildings. Priority is given to reuse of available federally owned historic buildings, then to non-Federal historic buildings, especially those located in historic districts within central business areas. e. Because of the importance of these properties in America's history and culture, GSA has the further obligation to manage, maintain, use, repair, and improve these properties in a manner that will preserve their character-defining features and other qualities that make them eligible for listing in the National Register. This order directs that each property under GSA's jurisdiction, custody or control be evaluated for its historical and cultural significance, and that GSA consider the significant qualities of each property in planning and conducting its activities. This order also provides guidance for carrying out GSA actions potentially affecting non-Federal historic properties in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, preserves their significant features and qualities. The order further describes the statutory basis for GSA s agencywide stewardship vision and outlines a framework for integrating these stewardship goals with GSA s portfolio strategy and within a cost-conscious, customer-focused business environment. 7 2. Objectives Objectives of this order are to: a. Define GSA's historic preservation program and its direction. b.

Subsection 6(c) of the order directs agencies, when planning for new facilities and leases, to consider neighborhoods and locations that are near existing employment centers and accessible to a broad range of the region s workforce and population by public transit (where it exists), consistent with E.O. 12072. associated with federal facility siting and development and to engage with any community that may be affected, along with appropriate regional and local officials, to mitigate those displacement risks. It further directs agencies to identify displacement risks 3. Regulations a. 36 C.F.R. part 800, Protection of Historic Properties. These regulations, issued by the Council and binding on all Federal agencies, establish procedures for agency compliance with Section 106 of NHPA. b. 36 C.F.R. part 79, Curation of Federally Owned and Administered Archeological Collections. These regulations, issued by the Secretary of the Interior and binding on all Federal agencies, prescribe how archeological materials and records produced by surveys and excavations under ARPA, NHPA and other authorities are to be managed. c. 41 C.F.R. part 102-73, Real Estate Acquisition. These regulations, issued by GSA, require agencies having a mission requirement to locate in an urban area 21 to give first consideration to space in historic buildings and districts inside central business areas. Agencies may give a price preference of up to 10% for space in historic buildings and districts. d. 41 C.F.R. part 102-75, Real Property Disposal. These regulations, issued by GSA, specify the process by which GSA transfers or conveys real property reported excess to GSA under title 40 of the United States Code. Pursuant to this authority, GSA makes available (i) excess properties to landholding agencies for continued Federal use, (ii) surplus properties for certain statutorily prescribed public benefit uses and (iiii) surplus properties, if not claimed for public benefit use, for public sale. The needs of the homeless have priority over other public benefit uses and, under subsection 102-75.1200(b)(7), where applicable, representatives of the homeless submitting applications must provide information that will enable the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to comply with Federal historic preservation requirements. e. 41 C.F.R. part 102-78, Real Property, Historic Preservation. These regulations, issued by GSA, provide guidance in furtherance of GSA s preservation program under Section 110 of NHPA for properties under the jurisdiction, custody or control of GSA or Federal agencies operating or maintaining such properties under a delegation of authority from GSA. The regulations outline Federal agency responsibilities to nominate eligible properties to the National Register and to consult with the SHPOs, the THPOs, Native American groups, and the Council to minimize adverse effects of Federal activities on historic properties. The regulations also describe historic preservation services that Federal agencies must provide, including preparing BPPs for National Register and National Register-Eligible Property under agency control and investigating proposed sites for Federal and leased construction to identify historic or culturally significant property. f. 41 C.F.R. part 102-79, Assignment and Utilization of Space. Section 102-79.60 requires that agencies use, to the maximum extent feasible, historic properties already owned or leased by the Federal Government prior to acquiring, constructing or leasing buildings. Many of these properties are in older city centers near existing community transportation and infrastructure, enabling agencies, in so doing, to fulfill the locational objectives of E.O.s 11593, 12072, 13006, and 13287. In addition, section 102-79.55 requires agencies to give consideration to available space in properties under the control of the U.S. Postal Service, many of which are historic, if space is not available in Federal Government-owned or leased buildings, prior to acquiring, constructing or leasing buildings. g. 41 C.F.R. part 102-83, Location of Space. These regulations direct agencies that have a mission requirement to locate in an urban area to give first consideration to locating Federal facilities in historic buildings and districts within central business areas. The regulations reiterate the goals of conserving existing 22 resources, encouraging redevelopment that makes downtowns attractive places to work, building new partnerships that promote historic preservation, and encouraging opportunities for locating cultural, educational, recreational, or commercial activities within Federal facilities. 23 CHAPTER 3. GSA'S HISTORIC PRESERVATION PROGRAM 1. Mission a. Public Buildings Service mission The Public Buildings Service (PBS) provides workspace for Federal employees in both Federal Government-owned and leased buildings. PBS real estate management activities include acquisition of sites and buildings, construction, leasing, repair, alteration, and maintenance. Within GSA's real estate inventory are many properties significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture. GSA planning, design, construction, and disposal processes have the potential to affect the integrity of historic properties, including both those under Federal jurisdiction, custody and control as well as other properties. Common cultural property affected by GSA activity includes archeological artifacts and other resources discovered during GSA construction projects, significant properties controlled, leased or acquired by GSA, and historic districts, sites and buildings adjoining GSA activity. b. Agencywide coordination GSA s national historic preservation program serves as a focal point for the development of strategies to facilitate agencywide compliance with the spirit and substance of preservation laws and directives. The office of the FPO, located in the GSA headquarters of PBS, Office of Architecture and Engineering, Center for Historic Buildings, is responsible for providing agencywide access to preservation-related information and support. This requires establishing cross-business and cross-regional lines of communication and determining which types of communication will most effectively convey different types of information. c. Agencywide knowledge building Providing employees with access to information on historic buildings, preservation procedures and guidance requires close coordination between GSA s national and regional preservation programs and its Service and Staff Offices. Establishing information management standards for data uniformity, accuracy and continuity requires structured regional and national office interaction and procedures to facilitate quality control. Incorporating Federal stewardship goals into GSA s business mission requires integrating preservation-related information systems and business-related information systems, such as GSA real estate, asset business planning, engineering evaluation, project information, and other databases. 24 d. Promoting efficient use of agency resources Supporting GSA s business goal of cost effectively providing quality workspace requires a nationally coordinated effort to promote knowledge exchange, to develop, document and disseminate best practices, and to eliminate redundant effort. e. Promoting public benefit from Federal efforts GSA strives, while meeting its mission, to create opportunities for public benefit from efforts and investments in which GSA plays a role. To the greatest extent possible, GSA s preservation program makes its historic building documentation, guidance and publications available to researchers and the general public through GSA s preservation program website and partnering arrangements with other Federal agencies and nonprofit organizations. GSA s national and regional preservation programs cooperate to facilitate public access to culturally significant property and public spaces important to the community. 2. Responsibilities a. Agency responsibilities under NHPA It is GSA s responsibility to determine whether real property that it manages or that may be affected by GSA action may be eligible for listing in the National Register and to seek alternatives that avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects upon the qualities that may qualify such properties for listing in the National Register in accordance with applicable regulations (36 C.F.R.   800.4 and 800.6, respectively). Many GSA-managed buildings are included in the National Register. The definition of historic property under NHPA also includes properties that are eligible for the National Register, whether or not they have been nominated for inclusion. Federal agencies are responsible for evaluating properties that may be eligible for listing in the National Register and determining the effect that agency actions may have on them. b. Agency responsibility outside of NHPA GSA has responsibilities with respect to certain kinds of historic and cultural resources, even if they are not eligible for listing in the National Register. Consideration of historic properties under NHPA does not necessarily satisfy all of GSA s legal responsibilities, such as compliance with NEPA. While most obligations relate to GSA s responsibilities under NHPA and E.O.s 11593, 12072, 13006, and 13287, others relate to statutes governing specific types of resources, such as underwater artifacts or human remains. 25 c. Public Buildings Service National and Regional Program Offices 1) All affected PBS national and regional program offices must develop plans, in coordination with the FPO, to implement this order. PBS Assistant Commissioners, Regional Commissioners and regional business line directors must take immediate steps to implement the provisions of this order. 2) It is the responsibility of each region within GSA to identify, evaluate, protect, and enhance districts, sites, structures, buildings, and objects significant in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture. These properties include those that are listed in, determined to be eligible for listing in or that may be eligible for listing in the National Register. 3) GSA must consider the needs of Native Americans, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians in the practice of their traditional religions. To protect Native American religious cultural rites and practices, religious leaders or other native leaders (or their representatives) must be consulted concerning areas of potential conflict arising from the management of properties under GSA s jurisdiction, custody or control, and efforts must be made to eliminate or reduce such conflicts. 4) Avoidance of adverse effects to historic and cultural properties must always be attempted. When avoidance of adverse effects is not economically feasible or technically prudent, or when factors related to an undertaking from the standpoint of overall public benefit warrant alternatives that may result in adverse effects, such effects must be minimized to the extent possible. If the adverse effects cannot be avoided or minimized, then the adverse effects must be mitigated. See chapter 4,  Regulatory Compliance Procedures.  5) Compliance with Section 106 of NHPA, E.O.s 11593, 12072, 13006, 13287, 13990, 14057, and 14091, implementing regulations set forth at 36 C.F.R. part 800, and related laws and directives must be integrated with other environmental considerations under NEPA and 40 C.F.R.   1502.25(a) of the Council on Environmental Quality's regulations implementing NEPA. All Services and Staff Offices are responsible for timely Section 106 compliance for each National Register or National Register-Eligible Property that may be affected by its undertakings, even if an EIS or an Environmental Assessment (EA) is not required by NEPA. Activities meeting NEPA Categorical Exclusion criteria must also be evaluated for potential effects that may trigger Section 106 compliance requirements. d. Commissioner, Public Buildings Service The Commissioner of Public Buildings acts for the Administrator in all agencywide historic preservation matters to the extent such authority has been delegated by the Administrator and represents GSA on the Council and in 26 connection with major agreements concerning GSA preservation-related activities and programs of national significance. e. Regional Commissioner, Public Buildings Service The PBS Regional Commissioner (RC) acts for the Commissioner in historic preservation matters within a region to the extent that such authority has been delegated by the PBS Deputy Commissioner. Signature authority for region-specific NHPA-related agreements, termination of consultations, correspondence, or other official matters generally has been delegated to the RC. The FPO must concur in such agreements prior to regional submission to the RC for signature. . f. Federal Preservation Officer Agencywide coordination of cultural resource management and compliance with NHPA and related laws, directives and statutes is vested in the FPO, who serves as director of GSA s national preservation program and policies. The FPO reports to the PBS Commissioner regarding preservation issues of national concern and on GSA activities presenting substantial legal exposure and risk of public controversy. The FPO serves as the Commissioner s delegate to the Council in Council meetings and related activities that neither the Administrator nor the PBS Commissioner can attend. The FPO is responsible for overseeing compliance with ARPA, NAGPRA, HADPA, 36 C.F.R. parts 79 and 800, AIRFA, HSA, and the historic preservation aspects of the ABA, ADA, PBCUA, NEPA, E.O.s 11593, 12072, 13006, 13287, 13990, 14057, and 14091, and related laws and directives. The FPO is responsible for: 1) Articulating GSA's stewardship vision; 2) Guiding regional and headquarters offices on the relationship between preservation and other agency goals; 3) Developing and implementing, in coordination with the RHPOs and appropriate PBS offices, GSA's national strategies to promote the use and viability of historic buildings; 4) Working with GSA portfolio management, capital investment and disposition programs to integrate and jointly implement GSA s national portfolio and stewardship strategies.

Regional Historic Preservation Officer The RHPO directs GSA s historic preservation program at the regional level and is responsible for coordinating day-to-day regional compliance with relevant historic preservation laws, regulations, orders, and directives. The RHPO acts as the liaison between the RC and the FPO and the SHPO, the THPO, the Council, and related local organizations. The RHPO, at a minimum, must meet the applicable Secretary of the Interior's Historic Preservation Professional Qualification Standards. The RHPO also must have expert technical knowledge of architectural conservation and rehabilitation principles and practices and demonstrated skill in building interpersonal relations to guide GSA project teams effectively, articulate complex positions persuasively and influence Section 106 consultation outcomes positively. The RHPO must be organizationally positioned and given authority to lead and manage actively the regional preservation program and implement national preservation policies and initiatives. Unless it can be demonstrated, with the concurrence of the PBS Commissioner and the FPO, that the RHPO is able to fulfill all required duties of the position in a part-time capacity, the position requires a full-time specialist functioning in a senior staff capacity. In carrying out these duties, the RHPO is responsible for: 1) Initiating consultation with the appropriate SHPO and THPO at the earliest appropriate stage in planning or consideration of an undertaking, prior to any action that may limit consideration of alternatives or mitigation measures. Copies of all correspondence sent by the RHPO to the SHPO and THPO or the Council, or any combination of the foregoing, must be simultaneously sent to the FPO, including relevant correspondence from the SHPO and THPO or the Council; 2) Consulting with the Council and other interested parties under 36 C.F.R.   800.3, 800.4, 800.5, 800.6, and 800.7 on regional activities and actions; 3) Developing appropriate plans for public participation under 36 C.F.R.   800.3, 800.4, 800.5, 800.6, and 800.7, and for effective management of communications and publicity on complex or controversial actions, in coordination with GSA communications, 28 congressional and intergovernmental affairs programs, as applicable; 4) Making preliminary determinations of eligibility and effect. Determinations of National Register eligibility and draft nominations prepared by the region must be forwarded to the FPO for review and concurrence prior to forwarding eligibility determinations or nominations to the SHPO for comment; 5) Participating in the development of regional portfolio strategies, including alternatives for remedying financially troubled historic assets, reprogramming historically significant spaces or buildings to serve new uses and creative real estate transactions, such as historic building exchanges, outleases and public-private partnerships; 6) Guiding regional housing and investment decisions with the goal of positioning GSA s historically significant buildings to be strong financial performers; 7) Providing Section 106 technical support to GSA s real property disposition program and legal counsel for excess and surplus property that is not in GSA s inventory and, for excess and surplus property that is in GSA s inventory, developing, in consultation with GSA real property disposition staff, legal counsel and the SHPO and THPO, transfer conditions and associated documents, such as covenants and design guidelines, to protect architecturally significant materials, features and qualities that may contribute to a GSA property s eligibility for listing in or inclusion in the National Register. Such documents may include agreements executed in compliance with Section 106 of NHPA outlining planned protective covenants and special procedures or provisions guiding the property transfer, redevelopment and oversight of alterations after conveyance. The RHPO and FPO also assist GSA disposal program staff with NHPA compliance for excess and surplus property that is not in GSA s inventory when it involves a complex, controversial or high-risk conveyance, such as with an NHL. 8) Reviewing all undertakings of Services and Staff Offices that may affect historic and cultural property and educating regional staff, through training programs and other means, about GSA compliance responsibilities and successful approaches for solving preservation challenges; 9) Reviewing design and construction project development documents for repairs, alterations and new construction affecting historic buildings, such as solicitations for design and construction services, scopes of work, specialist qualifications, design documents, site solicitations, construction documents, and contractor qualification submissions; 29 10) Providing technical assistance to project teams concerning appropriate materials, methods, design approaches, operational solutions, and resources; 11) Monitoring and guiding real estate transactions, such as site solicitations, leases, initial space alterations, and other activities, affecting historic buildings not owned by the Federal Government to avoid, minimize or mitigate harm to historic buildings and explore opportunities to use available historic buildings; 12) Coordinating regional compliance with Federal reporting requirements related to historic buildings, archeological activity and preservation matters, in accordance with NHPA, ARPA, E.O. 13287, and related laws, orders and directives; 13) Reviewing customer agency compliance with Section 106 and Section 110 to verify that it is completed and consistent with the requirements established by this order. Examples include review of customer agency-initiated alterations in historic buildings operated and maintained by a customer agency under a delegation of authority from GSA and, as requested by GSA disposition staff, review of customer agency documentation prepared in connection with a report of excess to confirm that agencies reporting property excess to GSA have completed the required Section 110 due diligence, including preparing required documentation, prior to GSA acceptance of excess Federal property; 14) Developing and negotiating compliance agreements and cooperative agreements between GSA and other organizations to further GSA stewardship goals; 15) Advising the RC and program directors concerning major preservation issues that may raise a high level of public interest, controversy or legal exposure and alternative solutions for resolving these challenges and managing risk; 16) Assessing, on an annual basis, regional success implementing GSA stewardship policies and programs in support of Federal stewardship goals. This assessment must include recommendations for improvement and a prioritized plan for addressing deficiencies; 17) Developing budgets and administrative procedures to facilitate regional compliance with preservation laws, regulations, orders, and directives, including survey and evaluation of buildings approaching or exceeding 50 years of age, preparation of historic building documentation, preservation plans and studies supporting planned repairs, alterations, 30 reprogramming, expansion, and other activities that may affect historic buildings, preservation-compliant design and construction, and related mitigation costs and expenses; and 18) Developing training, recognition programs and other initiatives to improve regional staff understanding of and ability to further Federal stewardship goals. h. Sharing of responsibility All GSA actions that have the potential to affect historic or cultural resources must comply with all applicable historic preservation laws, regulations, orders, and directives. Consequently, all GSA personnel need to be aware of and satisfy these legal requirements. It also is vital that all staff that may become involved in activities triggering compliance procedures are trained and informed so that the requirements are properly met. To minimize and manage risk, program directors must require program staff to request RHPO technical assistance and compliance coordination at the earliest planning stages of the proposed undertaking. 3. Qualification standards for GSA personnel and contractors a. Preservation staff Full-time preservation staff, including the FPO, the RHPOs and individuals representing the FPO or the RHPO, must be preservation specialists or historical architects meeting the applicable Professional Qualifications Standards for historic preservation professionals promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior and have sufficient knowledge of Federal and GSA preservation policy and procedures to carry out the requirements of this order effectively. 1) The FPO, at a minimum, must meet the applicable Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications Standards for historic preservation professionals, have applicable experience with historic building repair and alteration projects and a demonstrated understanding of preservation theory and design principles as embodied in the Secretary's Standards. This fulfills the requirement under section 110(c) of NHPA, 54 U.S.C.   306104, that each Federal agency have a qualified FPO. 2) The RHPOs must meet the qualifications described in GSA s standard position description for RHPOs, series 808 and 1001, copies of which are attached hereto as Appendix A and incorporated herein by reference, as such standards may be revised from time to time. addition, the RHPOs must have leadership and technical skills to establish credibility with GSA project staff and preservation review In 31 organizations to solve complex project challenges and to guide GSA decisions affecting historic property. The RHPOs should receive training in negotiation and conflict management to resolve conflicts in a manner that builds GSA s rapport with GSA clients, project teams, external organizations, and the public. a) The RHPO must have a working knowledge of: 1) Architectural history, historic building materials, and traditional building systems; 2) The philosophies and techniques of historic preservation; 3) American cultural development and urban history, as needed to analyze, evaluate and develop programs, projects and documentation regarding surveys of and planning for the management of regional GSA historic properties; 4) Technical and logistical requirements of field surveys for the purpose of resource identification and documentation, including technical skills in research and editing; 5) Technical literature (both standard and recent) in preservation and related fields; 6) Codified procedures, published rules, regulations and policies of Federal preservation programs, and an understanding of private and non-Federal programs and policies that may serve the objectives of historic preservation; 7) Existing and currently developing legislation on the Federal, State and local levels that relates directly or indirectly to historic preservation; and 8) Presentation, negotiation and conflict management techniques to represent GSA interests while serving as an effective advocate for Federal stewardship. b) The RHPO should be dedicated exclusively to the RHPO function and define it broadly to extend beyond perfunctory oversight of Section 106 compliance submissions to guiding the region s portfolio stewardship strategy and actively promoting a stewardship outlook in all PBS programs affecting historic buildings. Where this is not possible, the 32 RHPO should be supplemented with preservation specialist staff, on-site preservation contract specialist support, specialists on detail, or other means so that these skills are readily available to GSA staff and contract project teams to accomplish the program workload. c) To make a meaningful contribution to GSA s regional stewardship strategy and practice, the RHPOs must have a fluent understanding of how the region is organized and how major business decisions are made. The RHPOs must be positioned organizationally and functionally at a level that enables them to coordinate effectively with all business lines and management levels. 3) Preservation staff serving a support role in GSA national or regional preservation programs also may include student interns in an accredited preservation degree program or related academic discipline, graduates of such programs and individuals trained in affiliated disciplines, such as engineering and architecture, having appropriate training and experience to understand and support GSA preservation philosophy, policy and programs. Only individuals meeting the applicable Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications Standards for historic preservation professionals may be permanently appointed to positions as the FPO, the RHPO or official representatives of the FPO or the RHPO. b. PBS staff 1. PBS staff must be given regular training and guidance, as necessary, so that all individuals responsible for activities potentially affecting cultural property understand GSA s stewardship philosophy, legal responsibilities and procedural implications, such as expertise that must be procured or studies that must be performed to consider alternatives and avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects, as well as the time that must be allowed in project development so that compliance tasks can be completed within the project schedule. 2. Project teams should understand how to incorporate preservation compliance requirements into design scopes of work; to evaluate or obtain the necessary assistance to evaluate the competency of preservation professionals proposed for project design teams and specialist firms and technicians performing work on historic materials; to oversee the execution of design projects involving architecturally significant spaces and materials; and to take appropriate action in the event of discoveries or unanticipated conditions affecting a historic building project in progress. 33 3. Building Managers should be able to identify significant spaces within historic buildings they oversee and distinguish between historic and non-historic materials and features. They should understand and be able to apply the Secretary's Standards applicable to historic building repairs and alterations. They should understand which types of work require external compliance review and which types must be performed by firms specializing in historic buildings. Facilities staff should be trained to incorporate preservation requirements into design and construction scopes of work and to oversee construction contractors to guard against inadvertent damage to historic materials. b. Architect/Engineering design teams and consultants 1) Preservation architects, architectural conservators and other specialists involved in the preparation of BPPs, the study of project alternatives, the diagnosis and treatment of material deficiencies, or development of designs for repair, restoration, rehabilitation, and other work affecting historic buildings must meet the applicable Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications Standards for historic preservation professionals and be able to demonstrate successful experience completing similar projects in historic buildings of comparable complexity. 2) Detailed qualifying standards and procedures for evaluating contract preservation specialists are outlined in GSA s Qualification Requirements for Preservation Architects and Other Specialists, which is available on GSA s preservation program website. c. Construction contractors and technicians Construction firms and individual technicians performing work on historic building materials must have successful experience performing comparable work in accordance with the recommended approaches set forth in the Secretary's Standards. Such firms and individuals also must satisfy qualitative evaluation criteria associated with the specific trades and skills involved, as described in GSA s Restoration Competency Requirements for Construction Contracts, which is available on GSA s preservation program website. 4. Training and education a. National and regional training programs 1) The FPO, in cooperation with the RHPOs, establishes training priorities and methods so that all GSA staff involved in decisions that may affect historic properties understand GSA's stewardship goals, compliance responsibilities and practices. The national preservation program, under the guidance of the FPO, serves as a clearinghouse for resources concerning Federal 34 preservation regulations and procedures; GSA preservation policy; best preservation practices; real estate business decisions involving cultural property; and repair and alteration project planning. 2) Training for PBS headquarters and regional staff will include both formal instruction and written guidance to provide for maximum staff access, including online resources and advocacy building initiatives to foster stewardship commitment. Critical reference material will be made available through GSA s preservation program website, whenever possible. 3) NHPA compliance training will be provided periodically to all GSA staff and management. Executive training will include an overview of current regulatory requirements and GSA s responsibilities under NHPA and related laws and directives. Training for GSA staff will include guidance on initiating consultation and compliance review early in project development to facilitate appropriate consideration of alternatives before GSA is committed to a specific course of action. b. Regional training Training for regional PBS staff should be tailored to the specific concerns and challenges of each organizational group (e.g., asset management, project development, property acquisition, disposal, and facilities management). Regional preservation programs will provide ready access to basic information required for compliance with GSA policy and Federal preservation law, including: 1) A regional preservation homepage describing GSA s stewardship vision and responsibilities, with lists of regional historic buildings, RHPO contact information and a link to the national preservation program homepage. 2) Historic building resources, such as BPPs, HSRs, brochures, and preservation-related studies. c. Preservation program staff Preservation program staff should annually prepare individual development plans to support training required to maintain current knowledge in the areas in which they are advising, educating and interacting with GSA staff, contract project teams and outside review groups. 35 5. Core program activities a. Supporting Federal preservation laws and policy To comply with Section 110 of NHPA and E.O.s 11593, 12072, 13006, 13287, 13990, 14057, and 14091, GSA must identify historic properties under its jurisdiction, custody and control and establish plans for their protection, care and use. The FPO is responsible for developing, in consultation with the RHPOs and appropriate PBS staff, comprehensive strategies and procedures to facilitate GSA compliance with Federal preservation laws. The FPO also is responsible for effectively integrating regional and building-specific planning with national information networks and providing maximum possible access to historic building documentation and preservation guidance by GSA staff and contract project teams to promote consistency. The RHPOs, in cooperation with the FPO, are responsible for preparing and making available to GSA staff and contract project teams detailed building-specific plans to guide the maintenance and alteration of historic buildings GSA controls or uses. Regional BPPs, asset business plans and portfolio community strategies need to reflect national preservation policy to promote consistency and continuity. b. Information management 1) National and regional preservation programs must include provisions for maintaining records, artifacts and other cultural resources as required by law and as necessary to manage effectively the national historic building inventory, including: a. Current list of historic buildings in the GSA inventory, including National Register designation status. b. c. Current list of historic buildings leased by GSA. Current list of completed BPPs and HSRs. d. Schedule for completing BPPs for buildings for which BPPs have not yet been completed or for which BPP content is no longer accurate and current. e. Section 106 compliance correspondence and agreements. Copies of agreements and key decisional correspondence between GSA and the SHPOs and THPOs or the Council, or both, concerning projects that will or may result in adverse effects on historic properties must be provided to the FPO to facilitate GSA s ability to respond promptly to Freedom of Information Act requests, congressional inquiries and future project planning needs. 36 f. Current inventory of archeological artifacts and other cultural resources, including type, source, volume, and storage location, as required by 36 C.F.R. part 79. 2) Online accessibility To facilitate efficient access to building information and guidance, provision for online access to available guidance will continue to play an integral role in GSA s preservation program. Development of online applications will be coordinated with relevant PBS offices so that historic building information is linked integrally to appropriate PBS inventory-wide databases. c. Architectural images Architectural photographs provide critical information required by project teams, decision makers and others responsible for preserving GSA historic buildings. Appropriately detailed images inform historically accurate restoration and repair in accordance with the Secretary s Standards. Keeping historic buildings occupied and viable often requires targeted marketing that relies on high-quality images, including graphic simulations showing how spaces will appear after reinvestment. Federal risk management and continuous operation directives underscore GSA s responsibility for documenting historic buildings and providing remote access to information needed when buildings are damaged by circumstances out of the Federal Government s control. Reduced physical access to buildings due to enhanced security, travel funding limitations and other reasons increases the need for detailed visual documentation to meet GSA compliance responsibilities within limited time frames. 1) GSA s national preservation program maintains a historic building image archive and partnership with the Library of Congress to provide online access to architectural photographs in the public domain that document Federal public buildings. The national preservation program works with regional project teams to document completed preservation projects at buildings of exceptional significance in documentary films that are made available online. The program also provides guidance for documentation of historic buildings, sites, archeological artifacts, and cultural resources. 2) GSA regional preservation staff help regional program offices to use and build upon available visual documentation in connection with projects and activities involving historic buildings and to inform future projects. Visual documentation supporting the preservation of GSA historic buildings includes historic photographs and drawings, architectural photographs documenting current conditions, photogrammetric images and laser scan point cloud data for three-dimensional documentation, video, animated renderings, and Building Information Models. GSA national and regional program offices are encouraged to cooperate in 37 achieving the greatest possible value from GSA documentation efforts by: a) Specifying that contracts including architectural photography meet or exceed National Register standards and allow GSA use for agency purposes; b) Maintaining images in archival electronic file formats to enable future retrieval and reproduction without loss of quality or information; c) Conforming Building Information Model data to open standards for interoperability using nonproprietary file formats; and d) Maintaining databases containing architectural images with any documentation required for future migration and retrieval. d. Historic Building Documentation Resource HBDR serves a larger purpose as GSA s central repository for visual and narrative building documentation, including individual BPPs, HSRs, National Register nominations, and related studies key to maintaining and preserving historic buildings. HBDR provides a standardized system for the analysis, treatment and management of individual buildings, groups of buildings and the overall GSA historic building inventory. 1) Building Preservation Plans, Historic Structure Reports and related studies. GSA uses BPPs and HSRs to identify the qualities and elements that contribute to the historic character of individual buildings and to guide change accordingly. The HSR is the standard document used in Federal and non-Federal preservation to guide changes to, and the care of, historic buildings. HSRs include, at a minimum, a comprehensive survey and analysis of existing spaces and conditions, with detailed recommendations for treatment and maintenance. The BPP was developed to address GSA project team needs and ensure shared access by all PBS employees to basic historic building information. 2) Both HSRs and BPPs graphically delineate the architectural hierarchy of spaces in each building to show which areas require special care and which can accommodate greater change without compromising the building s historic integrity. Both documents provide specific recommendations regarding the care and treatment of historic materials and spaces. Data in BPPs and HSRs also can 38 be used to assist GSA in making decisions regarding investment in and utilization of historic properties. 3) Other technical studies and guidance. Technical studies concerning repair and alterations for areas potentially affecting historic building exteriors or significant interior spaces must be prepared only by firms and individuals meeting, at a minimum, the applicable Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications Standards for historic preservation professionals. Only individuals meeting or exceeding these professional standards will be authorized to perform internal GSA review of the technical studies. Technical guidance provided in the HBDR and GSA website will be regularly reviewed and updated, as necessary, by qualified staff so that the guidance remains sound and valid. e. Developing strategies to promote the use and viability of historic buildings GSA national and regional programs must cooperate to develop strategies to promote the use, full occupancy and economic viability of historic buildings, especially monumental or architecturally exceptional historic buildings representing the Federal Government s public building legacy. f. Promoting broad-based stewardship 1) Internal advocacy. GSA national and regional programs must develop educational programs and material using a variety of media to promote recognition and appreciation of GSA's historic buildings and stewardship efforts. Special attention should be given to historic buildings of exceptional architectural or historic significance and buildings considered focal points of the communities in which they are located. 2) External advocacy. GSA national and regional preservation programs must include activities for actively developing and maintaining positive relationships with external oversight groups, preservation organizations and the public. GSA preservation homepages should include building documentation commonly requested by the public and up-to-date information on projects and issues of substantial public interest. To the extent possible, GSA will make historic building documentation and preservation guidance it develops for its own historic buildings accessible to the public. 39 3) Promoting discourse. GSA's national and regional preservation programs must work together to improve the ability of GSA associates to respond appropriately to customers and external stakeholders on matters concerning historic building projects and historic preservation, to communicate a stewardship outlook effectively and to put GSA in the best possible light. 4) Performance measures. The FPO and the RHPOs will cooperate in developing national and regional performance measures to assess GSA s success in meeting agency preservation goals while fulfilling its mission. Performance evaluations for individuals and teams having substantial responsibility for activities or actions affecting historic buildings will include assessment of the individual s commitment to and success in meeting GSA's stewardship goals. 5) Employee recognition. GSA national and regional preservation programs will include provisions for recognizing exceptional projects, practices and individuals who advance GSA's preservation goals. g. Promoting best practices GSA s national preservation program will coordinate with the RHPOs and regional portfolio and project teams to identify and disseminate model solutions and best preservation practices. 40 CHAPTER 4. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES 1. Summary of requirements NHPA and other Federal laws require all Federal agencies to establish programs for managing historic properties under their jurisdiction, custody or control and to consider the effects of their actions on historic properties regardless of ownership. It is the responsibility of each Service and Staff Office within GSA to identify, evaluate, protect, and enhance buildings, structures, districts, sites, and objects significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture. These historic and cultural properties include those listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register. constructing new facilities, and disposing of surplus Federal real estate, GSA is responsible for carrying out these requirements. In managing Federal buildings, leasing non-Federal buildings, 2. General goals a. Use of historic buildings 1) In accordance with NHPA provisions and in furtherance of and consistent with E.O.s 11593, 12072, 13006, 13287, 13990, 14057, and 14091, prior to acquiring, constructing or leasing buildings to carry out their missions, each agency must use, to the maximum extent feasible, historic properties available to the agency. E.O. 13006 further directs Federal agencies to use and maintain, wherever operationally appropriate and economically prudent, historic properties and districts, especially those located in the Nation s central business areas. To that end, when locating Federal facilities, Federal agencies must give first consideration to historic properties within historic districts and, if no such property is suitable, to other developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts and, if no suitable site within a district exists, to historic properties outside of historic districts. 2) Under E.O. 14057,  Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability,  and E.O. 13990,  Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis,  Federal agencies also must include in the planning for new buildings or leases cost-effective strategies to consider existing community transportation planning and infrastructure. 3) To help keep Federal historic buildings viable, it is GSA s policy, to the extent practicable, to use Government-owned historic buildings first, especially monumental or architecturally exceptional buildings representing the Federal Government s noteworthy public building legacy, giving them greater weight in locational decisions and capital investment. 41 4) GSA also takes into account the relative importance of buildings to their communities, encouraging customer agencies to locate in central business areas where a Federal presence will bolster community efforts to revitalize older urban areas. 5) When space requirements cannot be met in Government-owned historic buildings, GSA seeks opportunities to lease space in non-Federal historic buildings and to make use of historic buildings on sites purchased for the construction of new Federal facilities. b. Meaningful consultation 1) General. Consultation with external review groups and interested parties undertaken in compliance with NHPA, NEPA and other applicable laws and regulations must be initiated early enough in project development to provide for an opportunity for meaningful comment and public participation. The goal of compliance consultation is to assist GSA in making decisions that address agency needs and public concerns to the greatest extent possible and to achieve better project outcomes. GSA customer agencies must be informed about these consultation requirements and given realistic expectations concerning project schedules and options. 2) Alterations to historic buildings. Design teams for projects potentially affecting historic building spaces and materials must include qualified preservation professionals with relevant design experience. These preservation professionals must actively participate in the project design and execution. Project design submissions must include preservation reports illustrated with appropriate photographs and drawings, submitted throughout the course of design development, identifying preservation design issues, and showing how they are being addressed. 3) Site selection and new construction. Site selection advertisements must comply with E.O. 13006 by inviting offerors to submit for consideration sites that include potentially usable historic property, especially those that are located near existing community transportation infrastructure and are accessible to public transit. Design scopes of work for new construction on sites containing historic buildings must require GSA project design teams to explore alternatives that reuse historic buildings and include reuse alternatives among the initial concept design options. 42 4) Public participation. Projects having a significant impact visible to the public, such as major exterior alterations, new construction, disposal, or change of use, must allow adequate time for public participation, initiating consultation early enough in project planning to allow for consideration of alternatives before decisions are made. Consultation for projects likely to result in demolition of historic properties or generate substantial public controversy must request the participation of the Council to assist GSA in anticipating public response and developing appropriate public participation processes to minimize GSA's legal exposure and the risk of project delay. c. Cooperation with local commissions Although Federal undertakings are not required to comply with local restrictions governing new construction or building alteration, GSA policy is to consult and cooperate with local governments, planning commissions and other appropriate groups to take community development plans into account in GSA decisions involving location, design and construction, expansion, major alteration, or disposition of Federal facilities. 3. Identification and evaluation a. Section 110 program requirements Section 110 of NHPA requires agencies to identify historic resources under their jurisdiction, custody and control and to establish preservation plans for their long-term care. To prevent inadvertent destruction of historic resources, the Federal process guiding changes to historic properties requires agencies to consider effects of their undertakings on properties that may be eligible for listing in the National Register, even if a formal eligibility determination has not been made. b. Section 106 compliance requirements In accordance with E.O. 11593, NHPA and the Section 106 implementing regulations (36 C.F.R. part 800), GSA must identify, evaluate, nominate, and protect historic and cultural properties under its control that may meet the eligibility criteria for listing in the National Register. BPPs must be prepared and updated for buildings listed in or formally determined eligible for listing in the National Register or determined by the RHPO or the FPO as meeting National Register eligibility criteria. Identification and evaluation of historic and cultural properties that may be acquired by GSA must be performed prior to, or as part of, feasibility, site acquisition or other studies undertaken to assist GSA in comparing agency housing alternatives. The evaluation must be completed 43 early enough to be taken into account without affecting the schedule, cost or practicality of an alternative. c. Eligibility criteria The eligibility of such resources is to be assessed according to the Criteria for Evaluation established by the National Park Service. Professional services may be employed, as necessary, to determine under which criteria a property may qualify for inclusion in the National Register and to substantiate GSA s determination. d. Nominations Each region must have a program to evaluate the eligibility of not yet evaluated properties, work with the FPO to nominate Eligible Properties to the National Register and complete BPPs for National Register and National Register-Eligible Properties over which GSA has jurisdiction, custody and control. Regions also must evaluate leased buildings over 40 years of age that are principally occupied by GSA or undergoing substantial rehabilitation to accommodate GSA customer agencies before alterations are initiated. Completed nominations, developed by regions with FPO review or by GSA s national preservation program with RHPO assistance, must be signed and submitted by the FPO for National Register listing and tracked nationally so that GSA s real property database, updated annually, remains current. e. Cost reduction Regions must seek opportunities to reduce the cost and effort of evaluating and documenting properties for the National Register by grouping similar, co-located or geographically proximate properties to achieve economies of scale and by preparing nominations in conjunction with BPPs or similar studies. f. Age threshold National Register eligibility criteria generally require that a building be 50 years old before it can be considered eligible for listing. To take into account the length of GSA s planning, design and construction process, a threshold of 40 years old has been established for assessing the eligibility of a building for listing in the National Register. The intent is to prevent project delays and increased design and construction costs due to new compliance requirements affecting a project already in development. g. Buildings under 40 years of age Noteworthy buildings under 40 years of age will be assessed according to the National Register criteria of exceptional significance, as detailed in National 44 Register guidance on determining the eligibility of properties under 50 and GSA studies on Federal public buildings of the modern era. h. National Historic Landmarks NHL is the highest level of National Register designation. These properties include buildings and structures that are nationally outstanding illustrations of America s historic and architectural heritage, as well as archeological discoveries and sites possessing exceptional interpretive or educational value. The National Park Service monitors the general condition of NHLs and Federal agencies are expected to give them special care. GSA is responsible for identifying, evaluating and protecting its properties that may qualify as NHLs, including properties that may have acquired additional significance since their initial evaluation. GSA closely monitors the physical and financial condition of the NHLs it controls and pays special attention to them when planning any actions that may affect their significant qualities. i. Properties of undetermined status NHPA affords the same protection to properties of undetermined status that are potentially eligible for the National Register as properties listed in or determined eligible for listing in the National Register. Care will be taken to protect properties that are in the process of being evaluated, whose nomination is pending or may be eligible, but require additional study to substantiate their National Register status. j. Identification of properties within areas of potential effect Prior to the authorization of any undertaking that may affect historic or cultural property under NHPA or NEPA, the APE must be investigated by a qualified firm or individual to identify potentially significant historic or cultural property. The program office responsible for the project or action must notify the RHPO early in project planning so that an appropriate identification study can be performed. The project schedule and scope of services must allow time for consultation with the SHPO and representatives of affected Native Americans, if any, during the formulation of the study plans, during the study and at the conclusion of the study. Studies concerning property affected, but not already under Federal jurisdiction, custody and control, by the Federal Government must include, at a minimum, the following: 1) Overview. An investigation of local, State and national inventories and a field examination of the study area by a qualified professional. The overview determines what information already exists on the area under consideration and provides the basis for determining what 45 additional information may be necessary to inventory historic and cultural properties within the study area adequately. The purpose of the overview is to identify National Register and National Register-Eligible Property within the APE. 2) Evaluation. An evaluative study is normally required to obtain sufficient documentation to apply the Criteria for Evaluation to previously unidentified historic and cultural properties. An evaluation involves intensive examination of the study area to make a professional evaluation of all historic and cultural properties within the area. k. National Register submissions 1) Nominations to the National Register. The RHPO or the Center for Historic Buildings oversees preparation of the necessary National Register nomination forms for properties determined eligible for listing by the FPO with SHPO concurrence. The FPO examines nomination forms for completeness, consistency, accuracy, and alignment with National Register documentation standards. The FPO is responsible for certifying that the nomination meets requirements set forth in 36 C.F.R. part 60 before signing and transmitting the materials to the Keeper. 2) Formal determinations by the Keeper. If the RHPO and the SHPO disagree on the eligibility of a property, or if an interested party raises a question concerning a property s eligibility, the FPO may request a determination of eligibility from the Keeper in accordance with 36 C.F.R. part 63. 3) Protect buildings pending final determination. When GSA, the SHPO, the Council, the Keeper, or an interested party disagree on the eligibility of a building, GSA will make a reasonable effort, pending a final determination from the Keeper, to protect the building and to preserve its character and architectural-defining features according to the recommended approaches set forth in the Secretary's Standards. The intent is to maintain architectural and historic character that may contribute to the eligibility of the building for listing in the National Register and design cohesiveness that contributes to asset value. 46 4. Long-term preservation planning - Historic Building Documentation Resources a. HBDR Resources HBDR is a comprehensive electronic collection of BPPs, HSRs and other building reports developed for the analysis, management and treatment of GSA s historic buildings. BPPs, like HSRs, provide descriptions and images of original and current building conditions, documentation of building alterations over time, color coded floor plans to show the relative significance of interior and exterior spaces, inventories of original materials, and recommended treatments. HSRs provide more detailed analysis of historic material deficiencies and building conditions, likely causes and treatment options to inform anticipated projects of a complex nature. b. Use of BPPs and HSRs in NHPA compliance BPPs and HSRs provide the basis for GSA compliance with Federal preservation standards in the development of architectural and engineering studies, such as Building Engineering Reports, seismic studies, Program Development Studies, feasibility studies, and fire and life-safety reports. Study recommendations must respond to the zoning that has been established in the BPP. All alternatives must be considered that will avoid or minimize adverse effects upon preservation zones. c. Use of BPPs and HSRs in building management BPPs and HSRs help GSA manage its buildings by: 1) Encouraging context-sensitive design that respects the architectural merit and material integrity of all buildings; 2) Discouraging inappropriate repairs and alterations that may diminish a building s historic integrity and asset value; and 3) Promoting employee and customer agency commitment to the proper care of GSA s historic buildings. d. Obligation to prepare BPPs GSA must prepare a BPP for each National Register or National Register-Eligible Property under its jurisdiction, custody and control. BPPs must be prepared in accordance with BPP guidelines, as issued by the Center for Historic Buildings, and professional standards for HSRs and similar building-specific preservation plans and handbooks, as issued by the Department of the Interior, American 47 Society for Testing and Materials and the Association for Preservation Technology. e. Basic Building Preservation Plan To facilitate GSA compliance with Federal laws governing alteration of historic property, basic BPPs must include, at a minimum, the following: 1) Building names (historic and current), address and GSA building number; 2) Real estate data, such as occupiable and gross square footage and construction dates; 3) Summary history describing the building s original and subsequent uses, principal owners and occupants, physical evolution, and notable events associated with, or having occurred at, the building; 4) Historic and architectural investigation describing original and existing conditions of the site, including the landscape, exterior, interior, site-specific art, and furnishings integral to the original building design; 5) Statement of significance assessing the building s architectural merit and integrity, historic significance and eligibility for listing in the National Register, according to the National Register criteria; 6) Photographs showing the existing and, to the extent possible, original appearance of the exterior (all facades and associated landscape) and significant interior spaces; 7) Preservation zoning delineating the architectural hierarchy of interior and exterior spaces to guide rehabilitation, preservation and restoration; and 8) General recommendations for conservation, rehabilitation and restoration, focusing on the locations of greatest visibility and significance. f. Comprehensive Building Preservation Plan NHLs, architecturally significant buildings and properties in poor condition may warrant a more comprehensive BPP or HSR to guide planning and design for anticipated or ongoing repairs, alterations and reinvestment. Comprehensive BPPs may include, in addition to basic BPP components: 1) Materials conservation analysis evaluating existing historic material conditions, diagnosing causes of observed deterioration and damage, 48 and describing the advantages and disadvantages of alternative treatments, including that of no action; 2) Inventory and evaluation of the building s associated landscape; 3) Photographs of all exterior facades, associated landscape, courtyards, and significant interior spaces, including circulation, ceremonial space, original executive offices, and special use spaces; detail views of all entrances and all entrance lobbies; and representative views of secondary circulation areas, standard offices and other rehabilitation zone spaces; and 4) Detailed recommendations for conservation, restoration, rehabilitation, or reconstruction, or any combination of the foregoing, including technical procedures for the repair and maintenance of historic materials and general guidance for addressing code, engineering and other deficiencies having a significant potential impact on the building s viability or historic integrity. g. Building Preservation Plan format Building-specific plans and studies may exceed BPP requirements and include additional information needed for a particular building or project but must be created in electronic format so that all relevant documents can be integrated into the HBDR database. Regional Section 110 compliance must include an active program to develop BPPs for all historic buildings and upload them into the HBDR for online access and inventory-wide reporting. h. Building Preservation Plan submission and review 1) BPPs must be circulated to the RHPO and the FPO for review and comment. Progress drafts should also be circulated for comment to the Building Manager and others having an intimate knowledge of the building. As internal asset planning documents, BPPs are not subject to external review or approval and recommendations are non-binding, subject to available funds. BPPs being prepared in compliance with a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) may be provided to the SHPO, the Council and other parties as stipulated in the MOA, provided that controlled unclassified information is removed or redacted. 2) Reports that have been approved by the RHPO and the FPO become a management plan for the property. From time to time, it may become necessary to amend an existing approved BPP to reflect changes since completion of the BPP. Such amendments must be developed in accordance with the BPP guidelines. 49 i. Data accuracy To keep information concerning existing conditions, alterations and recommended treatments accurate and consistent with current professional standards, annual regional programming for building studies must include provisions for periodically updating BPPs so that documentation and guidance remains current. Initial priority will be given to creating BPPs for GSA buildings for which BPPs are not yet available and updating BPPs for buildings for which major alterations are planned. j. Qualification standards and quality control. BPPs and HSRs must be prepared only by individuals or firms meeting the applicable Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications Standards for historic preservation professionals and demonstrating appropriate experience to assess and provide guidance on buildings of the type, scale and complexity being addressed in the BPP or HSR. GSA review team oversight of BPPs, HSRs and other preservation studies must be performed, prior to contract submission acceptance, by individuals who meet applicable Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications Standards. k. Building Preservation Plan and HBDR training. User guides, training and help programs will be made readily available to GSA staff and contract design teams to facilitate their ability to use and appropriately update information provided in the BPP and larger HBDR. 5. Promoting the use of historic buildings a. Economic development and heritage tourism Under Executive Order 13287, GSA is required to work with State and local governments and the private sector to promote economic development and heritage tourism through the use and interpretation of GSA historic buildings. b. Leasing of Federal historic property for non-Federal use (outleasing) 1) GSA is responsible for seeking adaptive use of historic properties not currently needed for Federal agency purposes. See Section 111 of NHPA, 54 U.S.C.   306121 and 306122. 2) Solicitation and selection procedures for leasing GSA-controlled historic property for non-Federal use under Section 111 of NHPA must give 50 preference, among financially and operationally viable alternatives, to uses offering the best possible preservation of the property and to lessees demonstrating financial capability and commitment, based on past experience, to meeting Federal preservation goals. Lessee selection for leases that include architecturally significant spaces originally intended for public use also must take into consideration the extent to which proposed use(s) will provide continued public access to such spaces. 3) All leases must contain such terms and conditions as necessary to ensure the use of the property in a manner consistent with Federal preservation standards. Leases must be for the minimum term commensurate with the purpose of the lease, taking into account the financial obligations of the lessee and other appropriate factors, generally not exceeding 60 years, except under unusual circumstances dictated by the stewardship needs of the particular property. 4) The RHPO must be consulted in the development of historic building lease solicitations, requests for qualifications and use, marketing strategies, and selection criteria. Any resulting lease will be executed only after review and approval by the RHPO, the Regional Counsel and the Portfolio Manager or Portfolio Manager s designee for consistency with GSA's legal, financial and stewardship goals and responsibilities. alterations resulting in adverse effects, the RHPO must coordinate GSA consultation with the SHPO and the Council. Time must be allowed to complete the consultation process (or achieve written consensus on preservation issues) before a leasing commitment is made. If a new use or occupancy will require 5) A sublease, assignment, amendment, or encumbrance of any lease issued under Section 111 authority may be made only with the written approval of the RHPO, the Regional Counsel and the Portfolio Manager or Portfolio Manager s designee. The lease may contain provisions authorizing the lessee to sublease the premises, in whole or in part, provided the uses prescribed in the original lease are not violated. Subleases must not relieve the sublessor or the sublessee from any liability nor diminish GSA's authority provided for under the approved lease. c. Property acquisition In making decisions concerning the acquisition of buildings, structures, and other real property for Federal use, whether by purchase, lease or exchange, GSA must give priority to the use of historic properties, provided such use is compatible with their preservation. See 54 U.S.C.   306101, PBCUA and E.O.s 11593, 12072, 13006, 13287, 14057, and 14091. Agency space expansion needs should be met, whenever economically and operationally feasible, through continued use of GSA-controlled historic buildings, supplemented by newly constructed additions or annexes. 51 d. Leasing for Federal use In compliance with NHPA and E.O. 13006, when space in Government-owned historic buildings is not available, GSA will give first consideration for acquisition of leased space to historic buildings that may be available for Federal use in accordance with the requirements of 41 C.F.R.   102-78.60. e. Declarations of excess 1) Program officials responsible for predisposition studies and other activities leading to agency declaration of excess determinations must notify the RHPO at the earliest opportunity that GSA is initiating excess procedures. GSA real property and personal property excess proposals must be reviewed by the RHPO prior to initiating retention/disposition, adaptive use, public-private partnership, or other studies or actions that may lead to a lease, transfer, exchange, conveyance, or sale. The RHPO must promptly notify the FPO and advise regional staff and management of compliance issues, risks or community interests that should be taken into account in evaluating retention/disposition options. 2) During this pre-decisional period, prior to conclusion of studies or actions that might indicate GSA commitment to a specific course of action or decision, the RHPO is encouraged to notify or consult with the SHPO informally so that SHPO comments that may inform GSA s utilization or disposition approach can be incorporated into GSA pre-decisional documents. 3) Once a disposition decision is made, GSA must afford the SHPO, and the Council, as applicable, a reasonable opportunity to comment upon the action. GSA will consult with the SHPO regarding conveyance strategies and conditions with a goal of avoiding adverse effects and promoting a positive stewardship outcome. and Assistant Commissioner for Real Property Disposition (RPD), RHPOs must coordinate with RPD prior to contacting the SHPO. In accordance with joint guidance issued by the FPO 6. Actions affecting historic buildings a. Tenant alterations and delegated buildings GSA is responsible for, and cannot delegate, its obligation to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to the identification and protection of historic properties. GSA must review proposed undertakings in delegated buildings for compliance with NHPA and NEPA. All required determinations and compliance submittals are the responsibility of GSA. 52 b. Project planning During planning for any GSA action, including site selection, new construction, repair, and renovation of existing facilities, leasing new facilities, termination of leases, demolition or other modification of facilities, and real estate transactions, GSA must consider the potential effects of the action on historic properties. Programming for required preservation planning documents, studies and recordation must be integrated into regional and national program procedures for capital investment, recurring repairs and alterations, maintenance, project development, site acquisition, and studies leading to declarations of excess and other real estate decisions so that preservation alternatives are not precluded. See Sections 106, 110(a)(2), 110(f), 110(k), 110(l), and 111 of NHPA, 54 U.S.C.   306108, 306102, 306107, 306113, 306114, and 306121 - 306122, respectively, and governmentwide regulations issued by the Council. In addition, NEPA imposes consistent, but independent, project planning requirements. 1) Consideration of community interests. The importance of buildings as cultural and economic resources within the community must be considered. The degree of community interest in a building must play a part in GSA s early and ongoing decision-making process. GSA must collaborate with Federal customer agencies and other entities to promote and maintain public access to significant public buildings and public spaces, especially those containing noteworthy architectural features, federally commissioned art, landscapes, sites, or views. When expanding, reprogramming or adapting historic buildings to serve new uses, GSA will make every effort to maintain historic primary public entrances as such and preserve public access to historic entrance lobbies and architecturally significant spaces. 2) Use of Building Preservation Plans and Historic Structure Reports. BPPs and HSRs will be used in planning all actions potentially affecting GSA-controlled historic properties. BPPs must be completed prior to the start of design development for substantial rehabilitation or capital investment projects at historic buildings and are a condition for capital project funding. Any design and construction work within a historic building must take into account the preservation zoning established in the BPP or HSR. Additions and annexes must respect, to the extent possible, the hierarchy of spaces established in the BPP. Effort also will be made to maintain historic lobbies and other ceremonial spaces in active public use. 53 3) Protection of National Historic Landmarks. Section 110(f) of NHPA (54 U.S.C.   306107) requires that agencies, to the maximum extent possible, minimize harm to any NHL that may be directly and adversely affected by an undertaking. In planning and actions affecting historic buildings, every effort must be made to maintain the viability of NHLs, to keep them in active use and to preserve the qualities that contribute to their significance. 4) Applying Secretary of the Interior s Standards to buildings of unconfirmed or debatable merit. GSA encourages its staff and contractor project teams to plan all projects, particularly those affecting buildings in which there is substantial public interest, according to the general principles of compatible and well-integrated design contained in the Secretary's Standards, regardless of National Register status. The general intent of these principles is to preserve architectural merit and cohesiveness, principles GSA supports as beneficial in maintaining asset quality and value. The Secretary's Standards complement other GSA and GSA-endorsed design guidelines, such as the Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service (PBS-P100), the Whole Building Design Guide and action-specific guides developed by GSA s Office of Architecture and Engineering. c. Coordination of GSA s compliance The RHPO will coordinate on behalf of the region GSA s compliance with applicable governmentwide regulations. Depending on the nature of the project or program and its likely effects on historic properties, compliance may involve carrying out one or more of the following actions: 1) No undertaking. Determining that the project or program is not a Federal undertaking for purposes of Section 106 of NHPA, and documenting this determination; 2) Federal undertaking. Determining that the project or program is an undertaking, and complying with the requirements of 36 C.F.R. part 800 in a timely and properly documented manner; 54 3) Implementing agreements. Implementing the terms of GSA s Routine Maintenance Activities exemption or an MOA or other agreement negotiated pursuant to 36 C.F.R. part 800; 4) Use of historic properties. Giving priority to the proper use of historic properties for program purposes, in accordance with 54 U.S.C.   306101, PBCUA and E.O.s 11593, 12072, 13006, 13287, 14057, and 14091, and documenting this prioritization; 5) Documentation of historic properties. Documenting historic properties subject to destruction or alteration by the project or program in accordance with 54 U.S.C.   306103, after proper compliance with Section 106 of NHPA has been accomplished; 6) Adaptive use of historic properties. Pursuant to Section 111 of NHPA, exploring adaptive use alternatives for historic properties under GSA control that are not needed for current or projected agency purposes; 7) Design review. In compliance with 36 C.F.R. part 800, reviewing project designs for conformance with the recommended approaches set forth in the Secretary's Standards, preserving original materials and designs to the greatest extent possible and, where necessary, pursuing alternatives for historic properties as prescribed in the ABA; 8) Compliance with related laws and regulations. As applicable, complying with related laws governing cultural resources, such as AIRFA, NAGPRA, ARPA, HADPA, and 36 C.F.R. part 79; and 9) Coordination with NEPA. Coordinating compliance with historic preservation requirements with review under NEPA and with proper reporting in the NEPA documents. 55 d. Compliance procedures for projects and actions affecting historic properties All GSA program offices responsible for a proposed project, program or action potentially affecting cultural resources are responsible for GSA staff and contractors' compliance with the procedures described below. Actions potentially affecting historic properties and cultural resources include site selection, new construction, building acquisition, renovation or rehabilitation, leasing, terminating a lease, and disposition of surplus property. 1) Planning stage. At the initial stage of planning, the responsible program office must notify the RHPO of the proposed action, with sufficient documentation to enable the RHPO to understand the project and its likely effects. Programs and individuals responsible for design and construction projects affecting historic properties must submit all building repair, alteration and rehabilitation proposals for each building to the RHPO for review and comment, including activities, such as historic material cleaning or refinishing, that exceed routine custodial, landscaping and day-to-day operational maintenance. The RHPO or the RHPO s designated representative must be included in all project teams and remain actively involved through completion of design and construction. 2) Implementation of recommendations by the FPO or the RHPO. Program offices must carry out the recommendations of the FPO or the RHPO regarding any studies, analyses, meetings, or negotiations necessary to achieve compliance. 3) Final project decisions. Final decisions regarding projects, programs or commitment of funds (other than for planning) involving physical changes to historic properties must not be made until the RHPO has notified the program office that compliance with all pertinent legal requirements has been achieved. 4) Assessment of effects. When a building is being considered for alterations, a qualified historic architect, architectural conservator or other appropriate specialist must be retained to guide design development, beginning with an assessment of the project s anticipated effects on significant spaces, features and materials listed in the BPP or HSR. If no BPP or HSR exists, the 56 architect must confer with the RHPO regarding the identification of significant spaces, materials and features. 5) Avoidance of adverse effects. In planning alterations and selecting alternatives, every effort must be made to avoid, or if unavoidable, to minimize, adverse effects on historic buildings and other cultural resources. 6) Locational planning. Long-term planning for agency relocation, expansion or other alternatives to fulfill new or changing space requirements must consider available historic properties, giving priority, to the greatest extent feasible, to reuse of federally owned historic properties, particularly NHLs, monumental buildings representing the Federal public building legacy and significant community landmarks. Real property specialists are encouraged, during pre-solicitation marketing research, to seek the assistance of local government, preservation organizations and other appropriate groups to identify historic properties potentially meeting GSA space requirements. Lease and site solicitations must reference the requirements of NHPA and E.O.s 11593, 12072, 13006, 13287, 14057, and 14091, as incorporated in the Federal Management Regulation and the General Services Administration Acquisition Manual, and encourage offers of historic property by providing historic property owners flexibility, to the extent feasible, in meeting GSA s space requirements. 7) Leased and acquired building space alterations. Consultation regarding initial space alterations and subsequent changes to leased or recently acquired space in historic buildings must be carried out in accordance with the consultation procedures for alterations to federally owned historic property. 8) Relocation of historic structures to another location. Structures or other historic properties may be moved to another location only if there is no prudent and feasible way to preserve them in place and only after compliance with 36 C.F.R. part 800. 9) Use of qualified professionals. Only qualified preservation professionals may prepare plans for the maintenance, repair, stabilization, restoration, rehabilitation, reuse, or interpretation of a historic property. 57 10) Compatibility of new design and alterations to historic properties. New structures, additions, alterations, landscaping, and other physical changes to historic properties must be designed and constructed to be compatible in form, scale, color, materials, texture, detailing, placement, and orientation with historic properties and their setting(s). 11) Historic building additions and annexes. Additions must be planned to provide, to the extent feasible, continued public use of and access to historic public entrances, lobbies, and ceremonial spaces. 12) Adaptive use. Changes undertaken to accommodate new uses must be designed and implemented in a manner that provides, to the greatest extent possible, that historic properties remain occupied, viable and architecturally intact. Changes affecting monumental public buildings or major community landmarks must be planned to provide, to the extent possible, continued public access to significant public spaces. 13) Supervision by professionals during construction. An archeologist must be on-site or on-call during construction to prevent damage to known archeological resources, to assist in identifying previously unknown archeological resources discovered during construction and to resolve unanticipated challenges associated with archeological discoveries or artifact recovery. A historic architect or architectural conservator must be on-site or on-call during construction to prevent damage to historic materials, to oversee the proper execution of approved preservation design solutions and to resolve challenges raised by unanticipated conditions potentially affecting historic materials and design. These professionals report to the RHPO or RHPO's designee, who coordinates with the Contracting Officer (CO), as appropriate. 14) Contracting Officer responsibilities. The CO has the responsibility and authority to halt any construction activities should historic, prehistoric, archeological, or paleontological resources; human remains; or Tribal Cultural or sacred objects be exposed or should unanticipated conditions arise that prevent GSA from honoring a commitment under an agreement or from executing a project 58 as agreed in Section 106 compliance review. Construction activities endangering such resources must remain halted pending investigation, resolution and, as applicable, recovery, in accordance with 36 C.F.R. part 800 and the requirements of NAGPRA. 15) Contractor qualifications. Program offices responsible for procuring contractors to perform work on or affecting historic building materials or architecturally significant spaces must hire only qualified firms and individuals to perform work requiring specialized preservation skills. 16) Added responsibility of the contractor. Contractors must be required under the contract document(s) to halt construction activities immediately and notify the CO, the CO s technical representative, the project archeologist, or the project architectural historian, or any combination of the foregoing, if historical, prehistorical, archeological, or paleontological resources are discovered during such construction. The CO must brief the contractor on these provisions prior to the start of construction. 17) Protection of historic properties during construction or vacancy. Contractors must be required to ensure that historic materials are protected during construction. The contractor must ensure that materials temporarily removed for later reinstallation are properly labeled, transported and stored securely to prevent damage or loss. Historic buildings must be secured and monitored during construction activity to minimize the risk of accidental damage by fire, structural failure or other means. The contractor and responsible GSA oversight staff must minimize the risk of vandalism or theft of historic materials or architectural features during construction or vacancy by instituting appropriate security measures. Historic material protection plans will be specified as contract submittals requiring review by an individual meeting applicable Secretary of the Interior s Professional Qualification Standards. 7. Participation by interested parties a. Participation requirements Section 106 of NHPA requires GSA to provide opportunities for interested parties to participate in the consultation process established by 36 C.F.R. part 800. Participation requires, at a minimum, the following: 59 1) Obtaining any information that individuals, organizations, universities, agencies, Tribal governing bodies, and others may have to assist GSA in carrying out its responsibilities under Federal preservation laws and regulations, including indigenous knowledge that may inform GSA efforts to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects; and 2) Making documents, materials and other data available, to the extent possible, concerning the undertaking and the nature of its effect on historic and cultural properties. b. Early involvement Involve interested parties early in the review processes established in this order through the public notification processes provided for in 36 C.F.R. part 800 and, as applicable, NEPA. Sufficient time must be allowed in project development to: 1) Involve interested parties early enough in the study of alternatives that comments and information provided by the interested parties can be included in GSA s consideration of alternatives; 2) Involve interested parties at appropriate intervals throughout the development of major projects or actions to facilitate their participation in the sequence of decisions or incremental actions that together determine the effect of the undertaking; 3) Take into consideration the needs of diverse communities for equitable access to information and opportunities for input; and 4) Provide adequate notification time to provide interested parties a reasonable opportunity to participate in and comment upon the proposed undertaking. 8. Determination of effect a. General The RHPO must apply the Council's Criteria of Adverse Effect to determine the effect of an undertaking on National Register or National Register-Eligible Property, in consultation with the SHPO and, as applicable, interested Indian Tribes, NHOs and other interested parties. b. Undertakings consistent with BPP or HSR recommendations After the RHPO has verified the undertaking s conformance with the BPP or HSR, project documentation must be provided to the SHPO for concurrence review. If the RHPO determines that the project is not consistent with BPP or 60 HSR recommendations, but can be modified to be so, the RHPO or the RHPO s representative will assist the project team or program office in revising the project proposal to conform to the BPP or HSR recommendations. If a BPP or HSR is not available, the RHPO will apply professional judgment, designating preservation zones to guide design development. c. Undertakings not consistent with BPP or HSR recommendations 1) Project development schedules will allow reasonable time for GSA consideration of alternatives, adjusting time frames, as appropriate, when adverse effects on historic property are anticipated. If critical project or mission goals cannot otherwise be met, the RHPO, the RHPO s designee or a qualified preservation project team member will work with GSA s project team, using BPP or HSR zoning and recommendations to guide preservation priorities and tradeoffs. Some projects will require iterative preservation problem solving to achieve outcomes that successfully balance preservation and other project goals. At the conclusion of this collaborative effort, the RHPO, the RHPO s designee or a qualified preservation project team member will prepare a narrative justifying GSA s planned approach as part of GSA s project documentation provided to the SHPO for Section 106 compliance review. 2) If the SHPO and, at its discretion, the Council, determine that a proposed undertaking is not in conformance with the Secretary s Standards, GSA must consult with the SHPO, and the Council, as applicable, giving serious consideration to suggested alternatives that may avoid or minimize adverse effects without substantively compromising GSA critical project goals. revisions to the proposed undertaking cannot be accomplished, the RHPO must attempt to resolve the adverse effects, in accordance with 36 C.F.R.   800.6, with the goal of negotiating reasonable and mutually acceptable mitigation measures to conclude the Section 106 consultation for the project with an agreement, as described in section 4.9, Study of Alternatives. If such d. Determination of no effect If the RHPO determines that an undertaking will not affect National Register or National Register-Eligible Property, the RHPO must provide documentation to support the finding to the SHPO. Interested Indian Tribes and NHOs must be informed of the effect determination concurrently. Unless the SHPO or other consulting party objects to the finding of \"no effect\" within 30 days, GSA may proceed with the undertaking. e. Determination of no adverse effect If the RHPO determines that the effect will not be adverse, the RHPO must send documentation to support this determination to the SHPO and, where required, 61 interested Indian Tribes and NHOs, in accordance with 36 C.F.R.   800.11. If the SHPO and interested Indian Tribes and NHOs concur with the RHPO s finding, GSA may proceed with the undertaking without further consultation. f. Determination of adverse effect If the RHPO determines that an undertaking may have an adverse effect on National Register or National Register-Eligible Property or if the SHPO objects to a GSA finding of \"no adverse effect,\" the RHPO must notify the Council, in accordance with 36 C.F.R.   800.5(a)(3) or 800.6(a), as applicable, and consult with the SHPO, interested Indian Tribes and NHOs, and the Council, at its election, to avoid, minimize or mitigate the adverse effect. The RHPO must coordinate with the FPO regarding the resolution of any disagreement with the SHPO concerning an adverse effect. g. Relationship to NEPA review process Compliance with the procedures stated in this order does not necessarily constitute compliance with NEPA, which includes a number of procedures and provisions that differ from those set forth in NHPA, such as consideration of traditional Native American sites and land features that do not necessarily meet National Register-eligibility criteria. Project managers must comply with the statutory provisions of NEPA. NHPA regulations encourage agencies to coordinate NEPA and NHPA processes to the extent that duplication of effort can be reduced; however, the inclusion of a section dealing with historic preservation in an EIS does not automatically constitute compliance with this order. 1) Consultation with the Council. Whenever a GSA undertaking will affect a National Register or National Register-Eligible Property and require NEPA compliance, the RHPO must initiate consultation with the Council as follows: a) Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement required. When a GSA undertaking requires the preparation of an EA or an EIS, the Council may be notified through the draft EA or EIS (see 36 C.F.R.   800.8). The draft EA or EIS should discuss, to the extent possible at the time of its issuance, the results of historic and cultural surveys concerning the undertaking's APE, the effect of the undertaking on all identified historic and cultural properties and the appropriate documentation necessary to fulfill the requirements set forth in 36 C.F.R.   800.11. When the draft EA or EIS is to constitute notification to the SHPO and, at the RHPO s discretion, the Council, the transmittal must be sent concurrently to the FPO, and the letter of notification must clearly 62 state that the draft EA or EIS is being submitted to request the comments of the SHPO and the Council in accordance with the procedures and instructions set forth in 36 C.F.R.   800.3, 800.4, 800.5, and 800.6. b) Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement not required. When a GSA undertaking does not require the preparation of an EA or an EIS, but the undertaking could affect National Register or National Register-Eligible Property, the notification requirement is met by providing the SHPO and, at the RHPO s discretion, the Council with timely documentation on alternative actions under consideration and their potential effects on historic or cultural property, in accordance with the procedures and instructions set forth in 36 C.F.R.   800.3, 800.4, 800.5, and 800.6. 2) Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement preparation. Any final EA or EIS prepared pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of NEPA, in addition to identifying the adverse effects, must discuss alternatives considered and describe the mitigation plans developed in consultation with the SHPO, interested Indian Tribes and NHOs, the Council, and other interested parties, as applicable. 9. Study of alternatives a. General Whenever it is determined that an undertaking may have an adverse effect on a National Register or National Register-Eligible Property, the RHPO must conduct, in consultation with the SHPO and the Council, if the Council elects to participate, and other consulting parties, if any, a study of alternatives pursuant to 36 C.F.R.   800.6(b) to avoid, minimize or mitigate the potential adverse effect. Where a property has significance based on Native American religious or cultural rites and practices, GSA must consult with the interested Indian Tribe(s) and NHOs to determine appropriate measures to protect and preserve Native American religious or cultural rites and practices. 1) Codes and standards. Acknowledging that historic buildings cannot always achieve new construction standards without substantial expense and loss of integrity, GSA encourages innovative solutions that reduce the cost and architectural impact of making buildings safe, comfortable and 63 accessible. Project design teams are encouraged to apply codes flexibly, in consultation with the RHPO, GSA fire safety engineers and other technical experts, and in accordance with the Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service (PBS-P100), and to assess actual risk within the building-specific context. Project teams are encouraged to explore appropriate alternative approaches provided in codes, guidelines and standards, such as NFPA 914: Code for Fire Protection of Historic Properties, Department of Housing and Urban Development Guideline on Fire Ratings of Archaic Materials and GSA s Fire-Safety Retrofit Guideline. 2) Architectural barriers. In making decisions about accessibility for persons with disabilities, GSA must consider whether planned measures may threaten or destroy the significance of a historic property. If so, alternative measures are permitted, as provided in ABAAS F202.5. b. Memorandum of Agreement When a proposed undertaking has the potential to adversely affect historic and cultural properties, GSA must take no action that could limit the consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures until the consultation process has been concluded. The execution of an MOA by and among the Council, the SHPO and GSA normally concludes the consultation process (36 C.F.R.   800.6). Alternatives that must be considered include: 1) Alternative locations. Carrying out the proposed undertaking at a location that will eliminate or substantially reduce the potential to affect historic and cultural properties adversely; 2) Alternative undertakings. Conducting other undertakings, actions, activities, or programs with similar objectives that could avoid or substantially reduce potential adverse effects on historic and cultural properties, including agreements with non-Federal entities in support of alternative uses and additional reinvestment to keep legacy historic buildings viable for continued or future public use; 3) Alternative designs. 64 Implementing other plans, designs or concepts with similar objectives that could avoid or substantially reduce the potential to affect historic and cultural properties adversely; 4) No action alternative. Taking no action; and 5) Avoidance of adverse effects. To the extent that it is prudent and feasible to do so, avoidance of adverse effects is the preferred option for all GSA undertakings. c. Programmatic Agreements An alternative to the standard Section 106 process is to execute a Programmatic Agreement (PA) with the SHPO and the Council. In a PA, GSA establishes an alternative, usually streamlined, review process for a particular program, type of activity or group of activities or a specific undertaking. A BPP can be the basis of such an agreement. All PAs must be reviewed and signed by the FPO. d. Adverse effect GSA must not give assistance to, nor may it collaborate with, any agency or private party with the intent to avoid Section 106 requirements by either intentionally causing an adverse effect or failing to prevent a potential adverse effect, unless and until consultation with the SHPO and the Council, if the Council elects to participate in the consultation, justifies such action. e. Anticipatory demolition GSA is responsible for discouraging the demolition of historic properties by other agencies and private parties in anticipation of obtaining a GSA lease or other benefit. See 54 U.S.C.   306113. f. Archeological sites GSA must regulate the excavation or other disturbance of archeological sites, consult with Native American groups about the treatment of any traditional cultural or religious properties that may be present and protect Native American cultural items. See 54 U.S.C.   306102, ARPA and its implementing regulations (43 C.F.R. part 7), AIRFA, and NAGPRA and its implementing regulations (43 C.F.R. part 10). 65 1) Project planning - design. Design scopes and estimates for repair and alteration projects not large enough to warrant an EA or an EIS, but that will result in ground disturbance, must include appropriate research, as required by NHPA, NEPA and related laws, to determine the likelihood that significant archeological resources are present in the area to be disturbed (Phase I). Projects may need to include provisions for analysis of sample areas to verify the presence of such resources, should Phase I research suggest the need for on-site testing (Phase II). Preliminary consultation with GSA's RHPO, Regional Environmental Officer and the SHPO is recommended to learn what may already be known about a site. 2) Project planning - construction. Construction scopes of work for projects involving a likely discovery of archeological resources must include provisions stipulating the responsibility of GSA's archeological consultant team to advise GSA on the potential National Register eligibility of any discovered resources. In consultation with the SHPO (and, at the RHPO s discretion, the Council), GSA determines whether the significance of the discovery merits further resource recovery, analysis and curation. The goals and methodology of recovery, interpretation and curation should be laid out in an MOA. 3) Recovery. All contracts for recovery of archeological resources associated with GSA projects, whether the site is owned or leased by the Federal Government, must include provisions to produce an illustrated report of findings, including narratives describing the findings and their significance, for GSA reporting, publication, training, and public education purposes, as appropriate. Recovery report submittals must include captioned photographs documenting the type, material and size of each resource. Resource photographs must be included in the report of findings and provided as digital high resolution (public domain) images to facilitate research access to the collection. Any use by the contractor overseeing recovery or analysis of such resources or dissemination of information gained as a result of the recovery effort must credit GSA as sponsor of the recovery, the owner and, as applicable, the curator of the resources. Archeological recovery analysis reports must be prepared in accordance with Federal regulations and must describe the significance of the research findings and how they contribute to the body of knowledge on the location and broader historic or cultural themes explored in the study. GSA will coordinate with SHPOs, Tribal representatives and interested parties, as applicable, when security 66 considerations necessitate withholding location and other recovery details from public access. 4) Public benefit. Projects involving recovery of archeological, paleontological or prehistoric resources should include provisions for public benefit from research and recovery efforts. Archeologists should be encouraged to publish their findings, provided that GSA is acknowledged and the RHPOs and the FPO are given an opportunity for review and comment prior to publication. Project scopes of work and budgets for recovery should include funding for and consideration of alternative approaches for interpreting research findings and, when possible, provisions for public display of the recovered resources, considering diverse community interests to provide inclusive and accessible educational content. Examples of appropriate interpretation include educational videos, exhibits, interactive websites, and online publications. 5) Transport and storage. Resources recovered by the Federal Government remain Federal property in perpetuity, except as otherwise required by Federal laws and regulations, such as NAGPRA. Responsibility for the care of certain specialized resources may be transferred to other appropriate Federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense, Navy Department, which specializes in underwater archeology. Project plans and budgets for recovery also should include specific long-term recommendations for curation, whether by GSA or other appropriate entities, such as academic institutions, State historical organizations or non-profit research groups. At a minimum, agreements for long-term curation should provide that the resources will be secure from theft or damage and maintained in a climate-controlled environment in compliance with Department of the Interior standards for storage and curation of archeological artifacts (see 36 C.F.R. part 79). 6) Archeological resources. Archeological collections in GSA's custody must be managed properly by appropriately equipped institutions, according to the Secretary of the Interior's standards for storage and curation of archeological artifacts, and in compliance with ARPA and HADPA. repatriate Native American cultural items in such collections to lineal descendants, Indian Tribes or NHOs (see sections 5-7 of NAGPRA and 43 C.F.R. part 10). In addition, GSA must 67 a) Archeological collections. Archeological collections must be preserved, inventoried, interpreted, and curated in accordance with 36 C.F.R. part 79. The FPO and the appropriate RHPO must maintain current inventories identifying all resources, their current locations and other information as required by Federal regulations. Information regarding GSA s archeological collections and archeological research findings funded under GSA projects must be made readily available to researchers and the public, as appropriate, through the Internet and other appropriate means. b) Public access to collections. Provisions must be made to provide access to GSA s archeological collection by researchers and appropriate institutions for public benefit, except as otherwise provided by Federal laws and regulations, such NAGPRA. Procedures must be established and permanent records maintained to provide for the security and proper care of resources removed from storage for such purposes. The RHPO is responsible for carrying out the recovery, transport, storage, and loaning of archeological resources for research or exhibit purposes in compliance with Federal laws, regulations and GSA policy. g. Vessels and underwater artifacts GSA is responsible for Section 106 compliance associated with potentially significant Federal underwater artifacts, such as sunken Civil War vessels, which may be affected by Federal undertakings such as coastal dredging. Undertakings that involve historic personal property must be coordinated with the GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Office of Personal Property Management and FAS must concur on any documents that evidence GSA s compliance with Section 106. Underwater artifacts are typically transferred to the Navy and curated by the Naval History and Heritage Command or other appropriate institutions. MOAs and PAs delineating responsibilities associated with identification, analysis and curation may involve Federal and non-Federal participants, including the agency whose activities resulted in the discovery and is responsible for identification and reclamation, GSA (as the Federal agency with jurisdiction over the artifacts), the Federal agency assuming jurisdiction over the artifacts (if other than GSA), the curating entity, the SHPO, the Council (if involved), and any interested parties, such as local historical groups. Agreements should include provisions for reassigning curatorial responsibilities, should unforeseen events prevent the curating organization from meeting the agreement's requirements. 68 h. Excess property 1) Property declared excess by other agencies. As required by 41 C.F.R.   102-78.70, Federal agencies must satisfy their historic preservation compliance responsibilities concerning property declared excess by them prior to transfer or sale by GSA. To that end, GSA real property disposition program staff work with landholding agencies to verify that Section 110 documentation has been completed or to assist them in completing required Section 110 documentation or making other arrangements acceptable to GSA. section 2(f) of E.O. 11593, GSA is responsible for incorporating provisions for the protection of the historic property into the transfer or sale of such property. GSA's procedures for handling disposition undertakings involving historic real property must support long-term stewardship, as well as immediate preservation needs. In accordance with the requirements of 2) Historic property transfers. In accordance with Sections 106 and 111 of NHPA and as further provided in 41 C.F.R.   102-78.65, GSA's procedures governing the transfer of historic properties incorporate all available authorities to support preservation goals for long-term stewardship. In furtherance of Section 111 of NHPA, 41 C.F.R.   102-78.65 requires that Federal agencies must, to the extent practicable, establish and implement alternatives for historic properties, including adaptive use, that are not needed for current or projected agency purposes. Prior to initiating disposition actions for underutilized or poorly performing historic buildings in GSA s inventory, in accordance with 41 C.F.R.   102-79.60 and GSA s Portfolio Strategy, GSA must explore appropriate financial remedies, such as targeted reinvestment, return on investment pricing, marketing of vacant space to other Federal agencies, and supplementing a predominantly Federal use with leasing to non-Federal tenants. The FPO maintains primary compliance authority while historic properties remain in GSA custody and control, working with GSA s real property disposition program to minimize risk and address GSA interests while encouraging sound and stable stewardship outcomes. Real property disposition program staff must coordinate with the RHPO to integrate provisions for the protection of historic property into the transfer or sale procedures and documents, in conformance with the requirements of subsection 2(f) of E.O. 11593. Based on site-specific factors, such as the property condition, market, availability of an enforcer, and significance, such considerations may be addressed in preservation covenants referencing architectural features identified within a BPP or HSR, Section 106 agreements guiding post-transfer redevelopment and the choice of the statutory authority that governs the conveyance. Provisions for mitigation of adverse effects to National Register and National 69 Register-Eligible Property that might occur as a direct or indirect result of the transfer should be proportionate to the extent or degree of such effects. a) Public benefit conveyance. The Real Property Disposition Program coordinates with public benefit conveyance sponsoring agencies. These include, among others, the U.S. Department of Education for education-related uses and the U.S. Department of the Interior for historic surplus property public benefit conveyances. b) Historic Surplus Property Public Benefit Conveyance. Outreach to the U.S. Department of the Interior regarding historic surplus property public benefit conveyances and disposition of non-GSA NHLs must be coordinated through RPD, in accordance with the real property disposition provisions in title 40 of the United States Code and joint guidance. c) Monumental properties and iconic public buildings. Conveyance strategies for monumental properties, architectural icons and other historic buildings of high community interest should encourage compatible reuse approaches that preserve significant spaces and maintain, to the extent feasible and appropriate, continued public access to spaces designed for public use. RPD must work closely with the FPO and RHPO on strategies for best balancing GSA business, stewardship and community goals when conveyances involve NHLs, highly significant property or likely controversy. d) National Historic Landmarks. The National Park Service must be notified, in writing, when an NHL will be transferred to another Federal agency or non-Federal entity so that the National Park Service may fulfill its administrative responsibilities under 36 C.F.R. 65.7(a). In accordance with 36 C.F.R. 800.10(c), the FPO or the FPO s RHPO designee must notify the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary s designee of any consultation involving an NHL and invite the designee to participate in the consultation when there may be an adverse effect that is associated with GSA s disposition action. 70 e) Covenant enforcement and unanticipated changes. To the extent possible, conveyance documents involving highly significant historic property must include provisions for monitoring and enforcement of preservation conditions. Transfers of highly significant historic property designed for public access should include provisions encouraging continued public access in the unanticipated event of subsequent transfer or change of use. i. Abandoned property. The Administrator of GSA is authorized to make such contracts and provisions for the preservation, sale or collection of any property, or the proceeds thereof, which may have been wrecked, abandoned or become derelict, if the Administrator considers the contracts and provisions to be in the interest of the Federal Government and the property is within the jurisdiction of the United States and should come to the United States (40 U.S.C.   1309). This authority, which extends to certain underwater properties, must be exercised in coordination with ARPA, ASA, HADPA, and GSA Order FSS 2800.23, entitled  Treasure Trove Contracts,  dated January 15, 1987. For additional information, see section 4 and subsection 6(d) of ASA and its implementing guidelines (55 Fed. Reg. 50116 (1990)). 10. Development of project compliance documentation a. General Solicitations and scopes of work for feasibility studies, site acquisition, lease acquisition, Program Development Studies, design and construction, and other activities governed by Federal preservation laws and directives must include provisions so that appropriate analyses of alternatives and preparation of compliance review submission material is completed in a timely manner by qualified professionals and that preservation considerations are fully integrated into GSA project development processes, decisions and actions potentially affecting historic buildings or material of cultural significance. b. Compliance submission requirements 1) Submission materials developed for external review in compliance with Section 106 of NHPA and related laws must be prepared only by individuals meeting the Professional Qualifications Standards who are able to demonstrate successful experience on comparable preservation projects. Documentation prepared internally by GSA may be developed only by or under the supervision of individuals meeting these criteria so that preservation issues are properly identified, and that GSA maintains professional credibility in external reviews. 71 2) Section 106 compliance submission material is to be developed concurrently with project development by individuals actively engaged in all discussions and reviews leading to actions or decisions that may affect historic buildings as defined in 36 C.F.R. part 800. Project managers and team members will be provided guidance by GSA s Center for Historic Buildings for integrating the compliance process and GSA s options analysis so that the process serves to inform GSA decisions, rather than document decisions already made. 3) Except under special circumstances warranting otherwise, compliance reports should be submitted to the RHPO as part of each design submission required under the project scope of work. Design submissions for projects in or affecting historic buildings are not complete and acceptable for invoicing until a complete compliance report has been received and accepted by the RHPO. c. Compliance submission reports Submission reports for Section 106 compliance and other external reviews must be formatted to focus specifically and concisely on relevant preservation issues, options, implications, and GSA s recommended alternatives, balancing preservation goals and GSA mission needs. Submissions must provide all information required for reviewers to identify and understand the potential effects of the project or decisions on historic properties and how GSA proposes to reconcile preservation goals and project mission requirements. Project submissions concerning design, construction, lease development, new construction, and other physical changes to historic buildings must include, at a minimum, the following: 1) A narrative identifying all preservation issues and options, justifying GSA s recommended alternatives; 2) Relevant research on as-built conditions, building evolution and affected historic properties, as necessary, to explain or justify the proposed project approach; 3) Photographs of existing conditions at each affected location, or representative locations, if conditions are identical or similar; 4) Elevations, plans and detail drawings or visual simulations showing the appearance of proposed preservation design solutions; and 5) A statement, signed by the qualified individual preparing the report, certifying that the report fulfills the Section 106 compliance submission requirements, including, for rehabilitation projects, that the proposed 72 design is consistent with the recommended approaches set forth in the Secretary's Standards. d. Compliance submission package Submissions to the SHPO, the Council and other external review organizations must include a cover letter, signed by the RHPO, stating GSA s determination of effect, with a brief rationale summarizing key preservation issues, solutions and approaches. 11. Mitigation measures a. Development When alternatives to avoid or minimize adverse effects to historic and cultural properties are determined by the consulting parties not to be prudent and feasible, GSA must develop measures to mitigate the potentially adverse effect. Measures to mitigate adverse effects to National Register or National Register-Eligible Property must be developed in consultation with the SHPO, the Council, if the Council elects to participate, and other consulting parties, if any. Where a property has significance based on Native American religious and cultural rites and practices, the RHPO must confer with the affected Indian Tribe or NHO to determine appropriate measures to protect and preserve Native American religious or cultural rites and practices. Such measures may include: 1) Modifying the proposed undertaking through redesign, reorientation of the project site and other changes; 2) Limiting the magnitude or extent of the proposed undertaking or identified alternatives; 3) Rehabilitating, repairing or restoring historic site elements and affected historic buildings for continued Federal use; 4) Compensating for the potentially adverse effects through, for example, the recovery and interpretation of scientific, prehistoric, historic, and archeological data; and 5) Minimizing potential adverse effects over time through preservation procedures occurring throughout or subsequent to the undertaking. b. Appropriateness Mitigation measures must be appropriate to the nature and importance of the historic and cultural properties in question. It is GSA policy to avoid or minimize 73 adverse effects to historic properties and mitigation should be considered only when avoidance or minimization is neither prudent nor feasible. c. Required documentation Whenever a GSA action may result in destruction or alteration of a historic property, GSA is responsible for documenting the property prior to its alteration. When the property is an archeological site, GSA also is responsible for notifying the National Park Service (see 54 U.S.C.   306103 and HADPA). d. Implementation GSA capital planning, design and construction, leasing, disposition, facilities management, and other program offices affecting historic property must cooperate with preservation program staff to fund fully, implement and document all required mitigation measures in the agency s Section 106 agreements. Schedules and budgets for capital construction, repair and alteration, leasing, and disposition projects must incorporate agreed upon mitigation measures so that GSA can meet its consultation commitments in a timely manner. GSA must not take any action that will prevent or unreasonably delay implementation of the mitigation measures without first reopening the consultation to seek an amendment of the agreement. 12. Architectural artifact salvage a. Preservation of historic architectural features Historic architectural features in significant areas as defined in the BPP or HSR, or in guidelines promulgated by the Department of the Interior, must be preserved and retained in place. When removal of original materials is unavoidable, and future reuse of such materials is feasible and likely, they must be appropriately labeled, protected, recorded, transported, and placed into secure storage. When reuse at the building from which they were removed is unlikely, salvageable historic materials will be made available for use at other GSA historic buildings, then non-GSA historic buildings, to the extent feasible. Consideration must be given to salvageability of materials as well as foreseeable prospects for reinstallation. b. Specifications for removal and storage Specifications for removal and storage should include stipulations requiring that care be taken during removal, crating, transport, and placement into storage to avoid damaging the salvaged artifacts. Unless exceptional size or other unusual material considerations warrant, all salvaged materials must be packed and crated during transport and storage, and labeled both inside and outside the crate in such a manner that the labels can be easily viewed when crates are 74 placed in storage and removed without damaging the object. Crates should be labeled on sides likely to be exposed when crates are stacked. Packing materials for artifacts designated for storage beyond the duration of the project must be of archival quality to prevent damage to artifacts during storage. Appropriate means should be employed to secure objects being stored in earthquake zones. c. Transmittal records. Transmittal records identifying all items, their materials, size, weight, and the specific location(s) from which they were removed and to which they are being placed into storage must be included as a requirement under the construction contract and submitted by the contractor to the RHPO and the FPO prior to transport and delivery of the items. A permanent record of all such items and their storage or reinstallation locations must be maintained by the RHPO, with a current copy provided to the FPO as the inventory is updated. d. Inventory record The inventory record must identify the items and specific locations from which they were removed; the age (design and fabrication dates) of the items, if known; date of removal and storage or reinstallation location; and contact information identifying program offices and individuals having direct responsibility for the security and care of the items. e. Future reinstallation If future reinstallation within the space for which the features were designed is impossible or unlikely, an effort will be made to install the salvaged architectural artifacts in an appropriate location elsewhere in the building or in another, comparable GSA historic building, provided that such installation is consistent with the recommended approaches set forth in the Secretary's Standards. 13. Discoveries Should historic or cultural properties be discovered after compliance with this order and 36 C.F.R.   800.6 is complete, and during the implementation of an undertaking, then GSA must notify the SHPO, the THPO, if applicable, any Indian Tribe or NHO that might attach religious and cultural significance to the affected property, and the Council, within 48 hours of discovery. The notification must describe GSA s assessment of the National Register eligibility of the property and proposed actions to resolve the adverse effects.

Purpose and Policy. The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government. The injection of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  (DEI) into our institutions has corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy. Orders to open the borders have endangered the American people and dissolved Federal, State, and local resources that should be used to benefit the American people. Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation. To commence the policies that will make our Nation united, fair, safe, and prosperous again, it is the policy of the United States to restore common sense to the Federal Government and unleash the potential of the American citizen. The revocations within this order will be the first of many steps the United States Federal Government will take to repair our institutions and our economy. Sec. 2. Revocation of Orders and Actions. The following executive actions are hereby revoked: (a) Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Govern- ment).

      "Summary": "Policy Analysis Summary\n\n1. Policy Summary:\nThe GSA Order on Procedures for Historic Properties (ADM 1020.3A) provides comprehensive guidelines for managing, preserving, and protecting historic and cultural properties under GSA's jurisdiction. The policy covers identifying, evaluating, and maintaining historic buildings, ensuring compliance with federal preservation laws, and promoting the stewardship of cultural heritage.\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nExecutive Order 14148 is a broad rescission of numerous previous executive orders, with a particular focus on eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives across federal agencies. The order calls for immediate steps to end what it describes as \"unlawful and radical DEI ideology\" and requires agency heads to review and potentially rescind previous actions.\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nAfter careful review, this executive order does NOT directly impact the GSA Order on Historic Properties (ADM 1020.3A). Specifically:\n\n- The policy is a technical preservation guideline focused on historic property management\n- The executive order primarily targets DEI-related executive orders\n- The historic preservation policy does not contain explicit DEI language that would trigger rescission\n- The policy's core mission of historic preservation appears unaffected by the executive order's directives\n\n4. Compliance Next Steps:\nAlthough no direct changes are required, recommended actions include:\n\n- Conduct an internal review to confirm no implicit DEI-related content exists in the policy\n- Maintain current preservation practices and guidelines\n- Continue adhering to existing historic preservation laws and standards\n- Monitor future guidance from agency leadership regarding policy interpretations\n\nRecommendation: No immediate action is necessary for this specific policy document.",

Summary of Policy Text: GSA Order ADM 1020.3A PBS\n\nGSA Order ADM 1020.3A PBS, \"Procedures for Historic Properties,\" establishes the official procedures for the General Services Administration (GSA) to comply with federal laws and directives concerning historic and cultural properties under its control. The policy is rooted in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and several executive orders (11593, 12072, 13006, and 13287). Its core mandate is for GSA to act as a responsible steward of these properties by identifying, evaluating, protecting, and promoting their use for the benefit of the American people and future generations.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text: Executive Order 14148\n\nExecutive Order 14148, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions,\" is a presidential directive aimed at reversing specific policies of the previous administration. The order's stated purpose is to eliminate practices related to \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI), border policies, and \"climate extremism,\" which it characterizes as harmful. The order explicitly and specifically revokes three prior executive orders: EO 13985 (Advancing Racial Equity), EO 13986 (Census Enumeration), and EO 13987 (COVID-19 Response).\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nThis executive order does not directly apply to or affect the validity of GSA Order ADM 1020.3A PBS. The analysis is based on two key factors: differing legal authorities and distinct subject matter.\n\n*   **Differing Legal Authorities:** The GSA policy on historic properties is founded on a specific set of statutory and executive authorities, primarily the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and Executive Orders 11593, 12072, 13006, and 13287. Executive Order 14148 does not mention, amend, or revoke any of these underlying authorities. The actions taken by EO 14148 are narrowly targeted at three specific, named executive orders (13985, 13986, and 13987), none of which are cited as the basis for the GSA historic properties policy.\n\n*   **Distinct Subject Matter:** The GSA policy is exclusively concerned with the procedural requirements for the management of physical historic assets. Its focus is on preservation, restoration, and maintenance. In contrast, EO 14148 is focused on rescinding broad social and economic policies related to DEI, immigration, and climate. The two documents operate in entirely separate policy domains. The core requirements for GSA to inventory, protect, and maintain historic properties are unrelated to the policy areas targeted by EO 14148.\n\nTherefore, the legal and procedural mandates contained within GSA Order ADM 1020.3A PBS remain fully in effect and are not altered by the issuance of Executive Order 14148.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nAs the GSA policy is not affected by this executive order, no specific actions are required to achieve compliance with EO 14148 in relation to GSA Order ADM 1020.3A PBS. GSA should continue to administer its historic properties program in accordance with the procedures outlined in ADM 1020.3A PBS and its underlying legal authorities.\n\n***\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

Although the `Policy_Title` is \"PBS 1095.8A, Floodplain Management,\" the provided `Policy Text` is unequivocally about \"Procedures for Historic Properties.\" It cites the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and various executive orders related to the \"use, protection and enhancement of historic and cultural properties\" under the GSA's control. The analysis is therefore based on the substantive text provided, which focuses on historic preservation.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions,\" is a broad directive aimed at reversing policies of the previ",

Although the `Policy_Title` is \"PBS 1095.8A, Floodplain Management,\" the provided `Policy Text` is unequivocally about \"Procedures for Historic Properties.\" It cites the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and various executive orders related to the \"use, protection and enhancement of historic and cultural properties\" under the GSA's control. The analysis is therefore based on the substantive text provided, which focuses on historic preservation.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions,\" is a broad directive aimed at reversing policies of the previous administration. The text explicitly identifies three key target domains for rescission: policies related to \"diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI),\" orders to \"open the borders\" (immigration), and regulations stemming from \"climate extremism.\"\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** There is no direct or significant indirect impact on this policy. The GSA policy is a procedural document that implements long-standing federal law (The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966) and is not a policy initiative within the three specific areas targeted by the executive order. The core function of the policy\u2014to establish procedures for stewarding historic sites\u2014is distinct from the DEI, immigration, and climate policy domains the EO is designed to reverse.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:** The EO's text focuses on rescinding actions related to \"diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI),\" \"open the borders,\" and \"Climate extremism.\" In contrast, the policy's text focuses on GSA's responsibility to \"Administer the cultural properties under their custody and control in a spirit of stewardship, trusteeship and sustainability\" and to protect \"sites, structures and objects of historical, architectural or archeological significance.\" There is a clear demarcation between the subjects and intent of the two documents. The policy is based on foundational preservation law, not on the more recent policy initiatives the EO seeks to eliminate.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** A potential indirect impact could be argued if DEI or climate change considerations had been recently integrated into the *implementation* of historic preservation. For example, if guidance under this policy prioritized the preservation of sites related to underrepresented groups (a DEI goal) or focused on climate-resilient retrofits for historic buildings (a climate goal). However, the EO targets the foundational policies themselves, not every potential application. This GSA policy is a high-level procedural order for legal compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, a mandate that is not affected by this EO. Therefore, the policy itself remains unaffected.",

The SME's justification is a true piece of analysis because it pinpoints the specific content\u2014the \"diversity and inclusion language\"\u2014that creates the potential conflict with the executive order. This is the most critical insight for making the determination.

Carnahan The General Services Administration s overarching goal is delivering efficient, effective government for the American people. As we look to the future, we re codifying another element into that goal: equity. The sacred trust between government and its citizens should inform every action, every decision, and every policy. It s our responsibility to get people the services they need, when they need them   that s why we re taking a people-centered approach to government. We know that government only works when it works for everyone, so I m proud to renew GSA s commitment to delivering a government that s equitable, accessible, and inclusive of the diverse nation we serve. GSA has a big role to play in fulfilling the mission of government, whether we re investing in American jobs, partnering with American industry and trade labor, delivering digital government with good customer experience, building a more sustainable future, or bolstering the strength of communities across the country. In all this, we re committed to making meaningful equity impacts, recognizing that equitable approaches lead to better outcomes for everyone. That s why our Equity Action Plan is so important. The heart of this plan is community and it provides us with ways we can both transform government in the long-term and ensure that what the government delivers has meaningful impacts on the daily lives of people all across the country. The good news is that we have the money and the momentum to make these kinds of impacts real. From Day One, the President has been focused on Investing in America   in our people, in our infrastructure, and in rebuilding our economy through historic, once-in-a-generation investments. I ve been out on the road a lot this year and I ve seen these strategies in action firsthand. To start, with over $6 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, we re making smart investments in GSA-controlled Federal buildings all across the country. We re focused on building spaces that are part of the communities they inhabit, modernizing them so they can easily provide services to the American people, and ensuring their resilience and sustainability. With every investment, we re seeking to address climate change because it s a triple win: creating good jobs, saving taxpayer dollars, and making a healthier future for generations to come. We know that historically underserved communities are too-often disproportionately impacted by climate change, so we re making sure that this triple win benefits everyone. 1 U.S. General Services Administration From Arizona to Ohio, I ve heard from workers that are proud to be part of this national transformation and that they see the benefits to their families, their communities, and American businesses. I ve met with trade labor unions, workers, and leaders in the building and construction industry, all of whom have shared with me how they re committed to these same goals. They re recruiting more women and people of color and training them in the tools and technologies we need to implement billions of dollars in investments. They know what we know: these investments will create pathways to the middle-class, strengthen communities across the country, and build a stronger and more prosperous future for everyone. At our federal buildings, we ve been partnering with local small businesses to guide them through the process of accessing opportunities across the Federal marketplace. We ve also been partnering with opportunity centers to raise awareness of these projects among the local communities. There s one location in D.C. where we ve helped over 35 businesses get onto government schedules and helped secure jobs for over 2,500 people. We re also focused on the physical accessibility of our buildings through our National Accessibility Program, the many efforts of our Office of Design and Construction, and our long-standing relationship with the U.S. Access Board. We also partnered with Challenge.gov to launch the  Access for All  universal and accessible design competition for U.S. architecture students to source best practice improvements. As the caretaker of the nation s largest public art collection, we ve preserved and expanded the people s collection over the last 50 years, placing art in Federal buildings and public spaces that tells the story of our nation and our democracy. We re committed to expanding opportunities for new artists to contribute, creating jobs while ensuring that the diversity and vibrancy of our portfolio reflects the diversity and vibrancy of the American story. Our Federal Acquisition Service and Office of Small & Disadvantaged Business Utilization are committed to making it easier for businesses to succeed in the Federal marketplace. From forecasting tools and new identifiers for a diverse range of businesses to training and outreach programs, we re actively expanding our supplier diversity, reducing barriers, and improving outcomes. In fact, GSA awarded more than $3.3 billion to small businesses, which represents over 50% of the agency's FY23 eligible spending, according to data current as of November 2, 2023. GSA s work delivering  services that are simple to use, accessible, equitable, protective, transparent, and responsive for all people  is evident in our digital capabilities as well. Our public-facing websites are 508 compliant, support assistive technology, and are available in multiple languages. In fact, Vote.gov has recently added its first Alaska Native language and multiple Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander languages to increase accessibility while supporting cultural vitality. We re also 2 U.S. General Services Administration engaging in equity studies across our Technology Transformation Services to ensure that we re providing human-centered tools that meet the needs of every American. We ve been partnering across the government as well. Our Office of Government-wide Policy IT Accessibility team helps agencies meet Federal compliance standards while our U.S. Web Design Services offers toolkits and best practices to ensure that Federal websites are accessible for everyone   that includes providing specific resources to support customers in varying socio-economic communities. Through our work with the Department of Labor s Good Jobs Initiative, we re helping improve job quality and create access to good union jobs free from discrimination and harassment for all working people, with an emphasis on people of color, LGBTQ+, women, veterans, immigrants, individuals in rural communities, and individuals with disabilities. Finally, we ve been committed to strengthening ties and trust between Tribal Nations and the United States. From attending the Reservation Economic Summit and hosting our first Native Nations Industry Day at GSA Headquarters to holding nation-to-nation consultations and visiting with Tribal leaders and communities, we re building Nation-to- Nation partnerships so that our work in Indian Country strengthens businesses and communities. Looking to the future, GSA s updated action plan aims to further advance equity through the agency s high-impact program areas like Federal procurement, Federal buildings, and Federal technology design and delivery. It also gives increased emphasis to GSA s role in helping to strengthen the government s ability to be more agile, responsive, and reflective of Americans  needs through evaluation and data-driven insights. By focusing on these five strategies, GSA will use its unique position of delivering mission-critical services and core products across government to act as a force multiplier in advancing equity and reducing burdens for underserved communities. That is what good government is all about   and GSA is proud to do our part to strengthen our democracy and foster more trust between the Federal Government and the American people. Robin C. Carnahan Administrator, U.S. General Services Administration 3 U.S. General Services Administration Advancing Equity Through Agency Mission The mission of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is to deliver the best customer experience and value in real estate, acquisition, and technology services to the government and the American people. As we work to meet our goals of delivery on behalf of the government, we are only meeting our mission as a federal agency if the American people can equitably benefit from our efforts. That means that as GSA leverages its over $85 billion buying power to provide Federal purchasers with cost-effective, high-quality products and services from commercial vendors, we are also advancing the diversity of the American supplier base and economic security for small businesses. When we provide critical technology services and modernizations, GSA has a mission to ensure that digital government is reflective of and designed to perform for all the diverse communities we serve. As GSA plans and completes large scale construction projects across our 375 million rentable square feet of Federal real estate, we do so in a manner that is informed by local communities to ensure that the sustainability, vitality and livability made possible through Federal investment is available to every American neighborhood. GSA s mission is government delivery   and that includes delivering on the American promise of equal opportunity, civil rights, and justice for all. Executive Summary In response to Executive Order 14091 on Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, the U.S. General Services Administration has undertaken an agenda to operationalize equity across its public-facing mission critical programs and services. Not only do these updated strategies build on the successes and learnings from our 2022 Equity Action Plan, they further integrate cross-cutting equity goals in important and impactful ways. Deeper synergies are possible to realize across priorities related to economic justice, sustainable and equitable development, customer experience and digital government, gender equity, environmental justice, protecting civil rights, and support for an ecosystem of sociodemographic community groups, Tribes, and institutions. Another core tenet of this plan is GSA s commitment to expanding Federal interagency coordination and advancing meaningful engagement with the public when it matters most and can make a difference. This collaborative posture reflects GSA s unique role in government as an agency that supports other agencies in their mission success. GSA s business is the business of government - whether that is helping buyers and sellers connect more efficiently and equitably in Federal marketplaces, modernizing and delivering high-impact digital solutions, challenging industry to join us in tackling the climate crisis through sustainable supply chain innovations, or driving the revitalization of American neighborhoods by putting people to work in their communities with good jobs paid for by once-in-a-generation infrastructure investments. This plan outlines five strategies to advance and embed equity in Fiscal Year (FY) 2024:   Advance Equity, Economic Justice, and the Diversity of the American Supplier Base through Federal Procurement. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objective of economic justice; and it aims to address barriers faced by small and disadvantaged businesses as they participate in the Federal marketplace. Key actions are designed to improve contracting efficiency and success through data insights, innovative procurement tools, and greater collaboration across Federal agencies. 4 U.S. General Services Administration   Deliver Equitable, Accessible and Inclusive Digital Government to the American Public. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objectives of Economic Justice and Civil Rights; and it aims to address potential barriers and biases present in public interactions with civic tech. Key actions include advancing human centered design and community-informed user research practices, scaling language access, and ensuring responsible adoption and procurement of AI-enabled technologies.   Advance Equity, Economic Security, Sustainability and Environmental Justice through Large-Scale Construction Projects and the Federal Buildings Footprint. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objectives of Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, and Housing Justice and Community Investment; and it aims to address barriers to community benefits realized through equitable and sustainable Federal development. Key actions are designed to improve planning and access to local opportunities - like good jobs and cleaner, more climate change-resilient communities, made possible by landmark Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act investments.   Advance Equity and Effectiveness of Federal Programs Through Rigorous Review, Evaluation and Continuous Improvement. This strategy supports the whole- of-government equity objectives of Civil Rights, Health Equity, Economic Justice, Global Equality; and it aims to ensure Federal programs are working as intended, particularly programs that provide critical support to the public during emergencies and recovery after disasters. Key actions include scaling the Federal Government s use of evaluations to surface important findings and areas of improvement in the design and delivery of Federal programs.   Advance Equitable Access to Opportunity and Federal Resources for Local Communities and Minority Serving Institutions. This strategy supports the whole-of- government equity objectives of Civil Rights and Economic Justice; and it aims to reduce barriers to access for institutions that, through Federal resources, help close critical gaps in capacity and infrastructure for the local communities they serve. Key actions include conducting proactive civil rights compliance reviews of the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program and broadening partnerships - including contracting agreements - between Federal agencies and Minority Serving Institutions. Approaches to the five strategies are meant to be tactical and have measurable outcomes. At the heart of these strategies are the American people   particularly those who are overcoming systemic burdens, have been locked out of a fair chance at opportunities or are disproportionately in the path of harm when disaster strikes. GSA has developed our agency actions to reflect the needs of the people, identified through data and feedback collected in our own regular engagement and evaluation practices and with the help of thoughtfully researched insights generated from trusted industry experts and Federal partners. 5 U.S. General Services Administration Equity Progress Updates and Accomplishments 2022 Equity Action Plan Update In January 2022, GSA released its inaugural Equity Action Plan in accordance with Executive Order 13985: Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. To develop this plan, GSA conducted equity assessments and identified a set of actions for three high-impact program areas: Federal procurement, Federal buildings footprint, and Federal technology design and delivery. The section below provides an overview of the key accomplishments achieved since publication of the original Equity Action Plan. Advancing Equity and Supplier Diversity in Federal Procurement   In FY 2022, $2.8 billion of GSA contracting obligations went to small businesses, including 21.4% to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs); In FY 2023, GSA increased its small business contracting obligations to $3.3 billion, representing over 50% of the agency s eligible spending.   Launched a new Supplier Base Dashboard to provide more transparency and public reporting on Federal efforts to increase the number of new entrants to the Federal marketplace and reverse the general decline in the small business supplier base.   Signed a new 8(a) partnership agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration to increase 8(a) contracting opportunities and make it easier for Federal agencies to buy from 8(a) businesses for common goods and services needs.   Established new contracting pools in the growing Federal marketplace of Information Technology services and solutions to bolster participation of Women-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran- Owned Small Business, and small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones. The 8(a) STARS III contracts have been awarded to 1,111 SDB. 290  rising stars  have received their first awards exceeding $925 million in obligations.   Expanded tools to support Minority Serving Institutions with training and technical assistance to achieve success in the Federal contracting marketplace.   Established a Post-Award Engagement strategy to support disadvantaged and socioeconomic small businesses, which oftentimes still face challenges in successfully earning sales after being awarded a GSA contract.   Published the first-ever Supplier Diversity Plan to support Federal marketplace participation of SDB.   Updated the Multiple Award Schedule Welcome Package and Roadmap to improve information access and assist new contractors with success in marketing and managing their contracts. 6 Advancing Equity and Accessibility in Federal Technology U.S. General Services Administration   Launched an Equity Study on Remote Identity, recruiting 4,000 Americans, to understand potential barriers and demographic disparities in identity verification technologies that are commonly used by the public when accessing Federal services and benefits.   Developed and started implementing a roadmap for USAGov and USAGov en Espa ol to streamline content and make it easier for the public to find and access Federal benefits and services across a digital platform that connects people with government information more than 117 million times a year.   Vote.gov worked to expand access to voter registration information in communities that, due to language barriers, have not been historically part of the electorate. The platform added several Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) languages including: Bengali, Khmer, Korean, Hindi, Tagalog, and Vietnamese, with Chinese (both simplified and traditional) and its first Alaska Native language, Yup ik- Akuzipik.   Login.gov partnered with Federal agencies and State governments to provide secure, accessible identity verification services for benefits and emergency assistance programs. As an example, the U.S. Department of Labor pilot in Arkansas, helping more than 19,000 citizens of the State verify their identities while applying for unemployment benefits.   Advanced public participation and equitable user research practices through user compensation pilots and increased outreach efforts to community-based organizations.   Partnered with the U.S. Web Design System to launch new Inclusion Pattern Guidance, a library of design guidance and examples focused on reducing the public s barriers in key digital government interactions and fostering effective, inclusive, and equitable digital experiences. Advancing Equity and Sustainability in the Public Buildings Footprint   Leveraged the Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool and Federal Interagency Thriving Communities Network to develop engagement strategies that advance sustainable and equitable development goals and connect communities with resources in large-scale Federal investments made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.   Established partnerships with the U.S. Department of Labor on the Mega Construction Project Program and Good Jobs Initiative to advance equal opportunity in the construction trade workforce and expand the use of Project Labor Agreements on Federal projects over $35 million.   Launched the Access-for- All universal design challenge for U.S. architecture students and apprentices to source best national ideas on improving the accessibility and gender inclusiveness of Federal properties.   Partnered with the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and updated the Art in Architecture program rules to expand public access and artist representation in the millions of dollars of commissioned artworks permanently installed in Federal facilities. 7 U.S. General Services Administration   Issued recommendations from the Environmental Justice and Equity in Federal Sustainable Buildings Task Group and appointed two new environmental justice subject matter experts to the Green Building Advisory Committee, a Federal advisory committee that explores the climate modernization and sustainable development of Federal real estate in ways that are responsive to the needs of local communities.   Commissioned a survey and issued a first-ever GSA report on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) practices in design and construction industries.   Partnered with the National organization of Minority Architects to expand career opportunities for underserved communities in the architecture, engineering, design, and construction industries. Additional Efforts to Advance Equity Implementation of Landmark Legislation   The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) was designed to address immediate needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on addressing historically disparate outcomes across race, class, and geography that were further exacerbated by the pandemic. To support the Federal Government s exploration of questions about equitable recovery, GSA s Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) established an ARP Evaluation Portfolio with two core elements: a national evaluation conducted by a third-party research contract, and a portfolio of evaluations conducted by OES, in partnership with agencies and the White House Office of Management and Budget, on ARP-funded programs with equity goals. This body of work explores effectiveness of critical relief programs like Emergency Rental Assistance and Homeowner Assistance Fund.   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides $3.4 billion for GSA s Public Buildings Service, making a significant impact on 26 Land Ports of Entry modernizations along the Canadian and Mexican border. These projects will create new good-paying jobs, bolster safety and security, and make our economy more resilient to supply chain challenges   all while serving as models for sustainability and innovation and improving community livability.   The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides GSA with $2.15 billion for low-embodied carbon materials in construction and renovation projects, $975 million for GSA to support emerging and sustainable technologies, and $250 million to turn even more GSA facilities into High-Performance Green Buildings and accelerate efforts to achieve a net- zero Federal footprint. These investments will reduce long-term energy costs for American communities, strengthen America s domestic industrial base and catalyze innovation and job growth in homegrown industries that produce next-generation materials, products, and equipment. GSA estimates that these projects will create over 9,500 average annual economy-wide jobs across the length of the projects, support $2.8 billion in labor income, and generate nearly $1 billion in tax revenue for Federal, State and local governments. 8 Support for Tribes and Native Communities U.S. General Services Administration   GSA has prioritized engaging in Tribal Consultations in a proactive and meaningful manner throughout Fiscal Year 23. In addition to robust Tribal engagement as part of BIL project planning, GSA hosted the agency s first formal in-person Tribal Consultation event at the Reservation Economic Summit (RES) in April 2023. Over 100 participants joined Administrator Carnahan and GSA leaders for discussions on major topics of interest to Indian Country, including GSA s support of tribes, small business contracting, partnering with GSA to procure electric vehicles, and a pilot program to support Federal buying of carbon pollution-free electricity from Tribal organizations. Also, GSA issued a Guide to Using GSA Solutions and debuted a new search feature that enables buyers to search for Native American business categories in the GSA Advantage! , GSA eBuy and GSA eLibrary e-tools to find commercial products and services. This will foster greater Native American business participation in the Federal marketplace, help customers more easily meet Buy Indian Act needs, and strengthen the ability for tribes to pursue intertribal commerce efforts. Environmental Justice   GSA is committed to institutionalizing the principles of Justice40 - ensuring that the benefits of Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution, advancing equitable and sustainable development, and mitigating the disproportionate burdens faced by underserved communities in the climate crisis. Our Good Neighbor Program helps construction project teams, local governments and communities address common environmental justice challenges - like flooding from aging water systems, heat islands caused by lack of tree canopy, and air pollution from commercial traffic patterns - during the urban planning process. GSA s Environmental Justice Scorecard highlights include 27 Tribal Consultations related to environmental justice from January 2021 to September 2022 and improving environmental justice literacy through training provided to GSA s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Network. Strategies to Advance Equity in Fiscal Year 2024 Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Economic Justice Strategy #1: Advance Equity, Economic Justice, and the Diversity of the American Supplier Base through Federal Procurement Barriers to Equity Through existing public research and GSA s own regular industry engagement efforts, the agency has identified core challenges1 facing disadvantaged small business communities that impede their success and contribute to persistent systemic economic disparities. Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) and Socioeconomic Small Businesses (SESBs)2 are vulnerable to compounding obstacles in achieving competitive pricing, administrative burdens in 1 The Probability of Winning Federal Contracts: An Analysis Of Small Minority Owned Firms (June 2022), U.S. Department of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency. 2 Includes SBA certified socioeconomic set-aside categories: 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Tribes and Tribal- owned businesses, and small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones 9 U.S. General Services Administration navigating government s diffuse information and processes, and disproportionately negative outcomes relative to other businesses while competing for Federal contracts and obligations   including the approximately $85 billion in annual contracts facilitated by GSA. GSA s plan to advance equity in Federal procurement coordinates and builds on key actions that take a holistic approach to reducing barriers and improving outcomes at critical stages of the Federal contracting lifecycle, with the goal to increase overall marketplace participation rates and the amount of Federal contracting dollars awarded to underserved and disinvested communities. Key Actions Enable greater Federal contracting marketplace transparency and efficiency through data-driven tools and insights. Federal agencies and the Federal acquisition workforce play a critical role in creating, sustaining, and growing opportunities where small businesses can fairly compete and succeed in being awarded government contracts. GSA is committed to helping buyers and sellers more effectively execute on all eligible small business opportunities, which includes our role in providing contracting data insights to the Federal Government and the public in support of these goals:   Expand Federal agency use of the Forecast of Contracting Opportunities Tool. The tool assists with acquisition planning by helping vendors learn about potential prime contracting opportunities early in the process. Improved search functionality will simplify the process for the Federal user to post and maintain opportunities. Maximizing Federal agency use of the tool and creating a single forecast for the public to access will greatly ease the burden on small businesses attempting to track opportunities across multiple sources of information.   Launch and scale Federal agency adoption of new Government-wide Procurement Equity Tool. The tool uses Federal contracting data sources to support market research focused on small disadvantaged businesses. Federal agencies can use the tool to find SDBs by geographic location, business type and category. Agencies can also find new SDBs that have registered to do business but have yet to receive a federal award.   Enhance eBuy, the Request for Quote (RFQ) platform for GSA Schedule. eBuy is a powerful and intuitive acquisition tool used by thousands of Federal agencies and military services worldwide to help save government time and money as acquisitions achieve required competition, best pricing and value. Planned and ongoing updates to eBuy include new features that benefit both buyers and sellers by creating more visibility and simplification in quoting, Request for Information (RFI), and RFQ interactions. Facilitate greater supplier diversity and contracting success through GSA acquisition products and innovation. GSA acquisition vehicles are trusted and proven entry points for small businesses to begin and find early success in the Federal marketplace. The Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) and Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) are standout sources of eligible award dollars available to small disadvantaged businesses to compete for contracts in Federal common goods and services, and in high-growth categories like information technology and solutions. GSA supports overall governmentwide procurement equity efforts by ensuring the universe of our own contracting opportunities drive innovation and are responsive to the complex needs of our customers and vendors. These actions include:   Establish and implement a new 8(a) partnership agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration. This new 8(a) partnership agreement makes it easier for Federal agencies to use GSA s Government-wide contracts, including the Federal Supply Schedules, to identify and make awards to 8(a) firms. Creation of an 8(a) 10 U.S. General Services Administration Schedule pool will allow for sole source opportunities to SDBs, which significantly reduces burden on small businesses to obtain orders and gain Federal work experience. GSA will update the solicitation to begin adding new 8(a) contractors to the Schedule, will enhance eTools to identify eligible 8(a) contractors on eBuy and GSA Advantage! and will update and roll-out training for its acquisition workforce and Federal agencies on the new process.   Create new sustainability-focused markets in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Defense. Climate risk adaptation efforts and Federal sustainability goals are positioned to deploy hundreds of millions of dollars in new acquisition opportunities, including those available to small businesses, over the near/medium term. GSA is driving new and emerging market successes in Low Embodied Carbon building materials, Zero-Emission Vehicles and supply equipment, scaling of eco-labels to reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and expediting procurement availability of environmental technologies.   Finalize solicitations and awards for new Polaris and OASIS+ contracts.3 These newly launched governmentwide IT and professional services contracts offer more opportunities for small businesses to compete for prime contracts, including small business and socioeconomic set-asides. Since 2015, GSA s current OASIS vehicle has helped Federal agencies obligate more than $67 billion. Improve accessibility and reduce administrative burden. GSA committed to reviewing 37 Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) forms and identifying six design changes to appearance and layout (e.g., limiting use of capitalization and italics, continuity of 12-point font and bolded text for readability) that could make the standard forms easier to navigate for people with dyslexia, limited vision and intellectual disabilities. GSA will redesign FAR forms and launch a public awareness campaign about the updates. For FY 2024, GSA will also increase its pledge to the AbilityOne program, a critical source for buying goods and services from suppliers who support the employment of people with disabilities.     Further implement and enhance the Post-Award Engagement (PAE) Strategy. Fiscal Year 2023 sales data for SDBs and SESBs will serve as the Year 1 baseline to evaluate the efficacy of PAE plan activities. Based on analysis, GSA will update actions for post-award interventions that address the phenomena of persistent low or no sales, including: targeted training, matchmaking industry days and technical assistance. Measuring Our Progress: Federal Procurement Equity GSA will know if we are achieving measurable results for the small business communities we serve by tracking quarterly and annual progress against key metrics, including:     increased number and percentage of disadvantaged and socioeconomic small businesses active in core GSA marketplaces; increased total dollars and percentage obligated to SDBs and SESBs relative to GSA s overall eligible annual spending;   downward trends in number and percentage of SDBs and SESBs with no or low sales;   upward trends in SDBs and SESBs average dollar value of awards and percentage of market share;   upward trends in SDBs and SESBs overall new entrants and increased participation in high-growth and emerging market segments; improved overall qualitative data results from customer and vendor surveys, focus   3 GSA is responsive to any protest decisions and remains committed to providing opportunities for small businesses while supporting Federal agencies in their small business goals. 11 groups, and training feedback. U.S. General Services Administration Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Economic Justice Strategy #2: Deliver Equitable, Accessible and Inclusive Digital Government to the American Public Barriers to Equity Although technology continues to rapidly evolve, persistent inequities in technology design and delivery   like higher false rejection rates, completion failure rates, and time burdens - disproportionately negatively impact those from historically and socially marginalized communities. Additionally, digital services very often fail to prioritize human-centered design and usability beyond compliance. This means that Americans who likely have a critical need to connect with government information and services through digital platforms also are likely to have the hardest time doing so. Examples include both lack of access to the newest hardware or good internet, which often means newer digital platforms do not perform as well (because they are not built for older devices or don t work with low bandwidth connections), or software that is not designed to work across all populations, such as lack of plain language impacting populations with limited English proficiency or poorly trained AI models causing biometric systems to perform worse for people with different ages or skin tones. GSA   through its consulting and fellowships offerings such as the Centers of Excellence and the Presidential Innovation Fellows, shared services such as Login.gov and the US Web Design System, and Federal partners in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and United States Digital Service   plays a central role in the responsible development, deployment, and procurement of technologies used by the Federal Government to communicate or interact with the public.4 GSA is committed to delivering high-impact digital services and products in a manner that improves customer experience, reduces burden, broadens access, and advances civic tech practices that are intrinsically equity-aware and community-informed. Key Actions Mitigate bias and advance responsible adoption of civic technologies, including machine learning-enabled and emerging technologies. GSA s own internal product testing processes, as well as publicly available, peer-reviewed technical research studies from academic institutions and government research partners - like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - have identified user experience disparities and efficacy gaps in machine learning and AI-enabled technologies that adversely impact users, including: people with darker skin tones, people in rural areas with low bandwidth, people using older electronic devices, nonbinary and transgender people, people with disabilities, and people whose native language is not English.5 The negative impacts listed above compound for government websites and digital services, including services that have the potential to impact rights (like access to benefits or other government services). For example, a user with darker skin tone who is more likely to live in a neighborhood with low-bandwidth internet access and have an older device is thus more likely to experience increased friction in their attempt to use a government website or service. 4 AI Guide for Government, IT Modernization Centers of Excellence; Blueprint for AI Bill of Rights, OSTP 5 Face Recognition Technology Evaluation (FRTE) Part 1: Verification (2023), NIST 12 U.S. General Services Administration   Complete the Equity Study on Remote Identity-Proofing and publish findings. GSA launched the study and is recruiting 4,000 members of the public for participation. The peer-reviewed final report will present a statistical analysis of the performance of proofing checks, like facial verification, across a number of sociodemographic factors and explore the causes behind any negative or inconclusive results. GSA will use the results of this study, in combination with findings from other Federal agency efforts, to establish recommendations and inform future product iteration, including on Login.gov.   Advance equity through civic tech shared services and large-scale modernization investments. GSA provides expertise via a portfolio of mission critical digital government projects through its universe of technologists and product managers in TTS Consulting, Presidential Innovation Fellows, U.S. Digital Corps and the Benefits Studio. The agency also supports improvements to government delivery and IT infrastructure, including automation, through investments made by the Technology Modernization Fund. These platforms are positioned to apply equity frameworks in the way government programs and services are effectively designed and delivered to the American public. Expand digital accessibility, language access, public participation and equitable user research practices. Traditional outreach, user research, data collection (including Artificial Intelligence-trained datasets), content strategy and customer experience testing methods often do not sufficiently include underrepresented groups. This means that as technology is built and deployed, those end users of the public who likely most need to connect with government information and services will often have the most difficulty accessing them. GSA will continue actions that strengthen relationships with stakeholders and meaningfully integrate the needs of communities as part of our digital services.   Strengthen relationships with underserved user communities and build capacity for research operations. Governmentwide customer experience efforts focus on improving the digital interactions of communities and individuals with accessibility needs such as physical or mental disabilities and those experiencing major life events such as recovering from disasters, emergencies or financial shock, new and expecting parents, and those planning for retirement. GSA will continue integrating usability testing and research operations capabilities, including the expansion of user compensation pilots,6 to directly track how well our digital services are working and meeting the diverse needs of the public.   Modernize GSA s high-impact7 service providers to improve digital accessibility and language access. GSA s public-facing digital assets like USA.gov, Login.gov and Vote.gov connect tens of millions of Americans to Federal services and information. GSA will continue modernization efforts to make our digital services more accessible, understandable, and easy-to-use. This includes platforming new language translations and designing from native speaker experiences, like USAGov en Espa ol, as well as driving universal design standards in partnership with U.S. Web Design System.   Develop a plain-language accessibility checklist in collaboration with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). This will enable any team developing cloud-based services and digital solutions to incorporate accessibility into their process, regardless of their expertise. Operationalizing accessibility knowledge and evaluation for Federal employee use helps improve overall digital government 6 Handbook: Doing Research at GSA Technology Transformation Services 7 Federal agency High Impact Service Providers (HISP) are identified by the President s Management Agenda due to the scale and impact of their public-facing services. 13 accessibility and performance outcomes for older devices, such as, and especially for mobile, rural, and low-bandwidth users. U.S. General Services Administration Measuring Our Progress: Equitable and Accessible Digital Government GSA will know if we are achieving measurable positive change in Federal public-serving digital products and services by tracking progress against key metrics, including:             reduced negative impacts (e.g., false rejection rates in biometric identity-proofing, task completion rates, slow page load times for low- and limited-bandwidth connections) and closing those efficacy gaps across sociodemographic factors increased product efficacy and higher overall scores in usability tests increased digital accessibility fluency and compliance across GSA high-impact products increased number of community-based organizations with active user research pipelines for GSA product testing increased and proportionate participation of users from underserved community groups in GSA product testing at scale increased number of available and platform-integrated non-English languages in high- impact digital services and products Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, Housing Justice and Community Investment Strategy #3: Advance Equity, Economic Security and Environmental Justice through Large-Scale Construction Projects and the Federal Buildings Footprint Barriers to Equity The Federal real estate footprint - including the 375 million rentable square feet owned and operated by GSA - has significant generational impact on communities nationwide. Federal construction projects act as anchors for economic security, reliable opportunities for good local jobs, defenses against the negative impacts of climate change, and can advance the overall livability and vitality of American communities. GSA s work often occurs in or adjacent to disadvantaged communities that have suffered from long-standing underinvestment and have dealt with historic challenges and barriers to equitable development. These communities tend to have poor transportation connectivity to job opportunities, higher exposure to many forms of pollution, and less access to green space. The impacts of this inequity are apparent in the persistent lower household income, high unemployment, and poorer health outcomes.8 In order to help overcome these barriers, GSA is executing projects with enhanced stakeholder engagement and data analysis to better inform GSA decisionmakers and project teams about local development contexts and better connect project location, design, and facility operations with the needs of those communities that will benefit from more equitable development. Projects implemented under the nearly $7 billion made available to GSA through historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) investments are poised to bolster economies with small and local business participation, improve job and jobsite quality for workers and trade labor, address sustainability and environmental justice concerns, and strengthen relationships between levels of government, Tribes, and communities. 8 Assessing the Legacies of Historical Redlining, Urban Institute (2023) 14 U.S. General Services Administration Key Actions Aid the economic success of construction industries, contractors, and labor forces. Governmentwide implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is estimated to create 800,000 good-paying jobs9, but the possibility of critical shortages in construction and craft labor could threaten the timely and successful completion of these projects.10 GSA is committed to scaling the impact of our BIL and other building modernization investments through collaboration with other Federal agencies and our industry partners.   Implement the Good Jobs Initiative partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor to create and support clear pathways for workers to high-quality, good-paying jobs in construction, maintenance, manufacturing, and operations. The actions outlined in the signed Memorandum of Understanding11 aim to support equitable and effective workforce development, including those from nontraditional and underserved labor sources; and improve job quality, standards and metrics on GSA construction sites.   Build and release new Geographic Information System (GIS) data-informed public forecasting resources for BIL and IRA related construction projects. GIS is a computer system that analyzes and displays geographically referenced information. It uses data that is attached to a unique location. By providing more visibility and transparency about where and when Federal projects are happening, GSA can help Federal contractors, trade labor, and community stakeholders effectively plan and better connect with opportunities. This effort will help more Americans, including those from underserved communities, with access to quality employment in their communities. Increase contracting opportunities for socioeconomically disadvantaged small businesses across growing markets in construction, clean energy, and sustainability. GSA will take actions aimed to maximize participation of SDB and build its small business contractor base by improving the forecasting process, strengthening relationships with existing contractors, executing its plans for industry engagement and utilizing the Governmentwide Procurement Equity Tool to identify eligible and new businesses ready to bid for work where GSA projects are located.   Achieve equitable and sustainable development impacts through data-driven insights, Federal partnerships and community engagement. New Federal integrated data mapping and urban planning resources, like the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool have provided GSA with deeper insights about community needs and challenges during the project planning process. This includes opportunities for GSA to collaborate directly with State/local governments and communities on ways to address environmental justice concerns, meet development goals, and scale impact through better and more robust coordination between Federal agencies.   Identify and announce a near-term portfolio of projects for targeted environmental justice and sustainability actions. GSA s Center for Urban Development/Good Neighbor Program will develop a priority list of site repair work at Federal buildings that would correct deficiencies in ways that also bring positive local sustainability impacts, address environmental justice concerns, and fulfill community planning goals. Relevant issues would include stormwater runoff, extreme heat, and tree canopy, as well as accessibility and improving aesthetics. These projects will provide meaningful benefit to the communities surrounding Federal properties and help to maximize the positive 9 Macroeconomic Consequences of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Moody s Analytics (November 2021) 10 Will a labor crunch derail plans to upgrade U.S. infrastructure?, McKinsey & Company (October 2022) 11 General Services Administration - Department of Labor Good Jobs Memorandum of Understanding (2023) 15 U.S. General Services Administration impact of GSA repair investments.   Continue Leveraging the Federal Thriving Communities Network12 to connect GSA stakeholder communities with additional climate and infrastructure resources. While GSA does not issue grants, it can proactively ensure that the communities we serve are better able to connect with place-based technical assistance and other IRA and BIL resources made available through Federal agency partners like U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Department of Commerce.   Complete a study on the impacts of Federal real property disposal. After it is determined that excess real property is no longer needed by the Federal Government, various statutes authorize conveyance13 to State and local governments and in some cases, to nonprofits at up to 100% discount for public benefit use. Some of the qualifying uses include public health, homeless assistance, education, park and recreation, correctional, law enforcement, and emergency management. This study will give GSA important new insights on how portfolio disposal decisions affect surrounding communities in the near and long-term. Measuring Our Progress: Equitable and Sustainable Public Buildings Footprint GSA will know if we are achieving measurable positive impacts in the communities where Federal construction projects and buildings are located by tracking progress against key metrics, including:     increased diversity in the supplier base, including broadened participation from Tribal and disadvantaged businesses contracted to Federal construction projects and increased total dollars awarded to these businesses as a percentage of project value increased number of small and socioeconomic businesses, including new entrants, awarded contracts in the region where Federal projects are located increased number of Project Labor Agreements executed     overall improved job and jobsite quality scores across GSA portfolio projects   increased and more accessible pathways to training and employment opportunities in regions where GSA projects are located increased initiation and execution of community development goals established during Planning Outreach and Partnership engagements     number of GSA community stakeholders who are awarded place-based assistance grants through Thriving Communities opportunities; indicators of reduced burden in disadvantaged Census tracts with GSA environmental justice ameliorations Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Health Equity, Economic Justice, Global Equality Strategy #4: Advance Equity and Effectiveness of Federal Programs Through Rigorous Review, Evaluation and Continuous Improvement Barriers to Equity The Federal Government s exploration of the equitable and effective deployment of benefits, resources and critical relief programs in the near and long term, particularly after national emergencies, is an essential part of how the government performs continuous improvement of 12 https://www.transportation.gov/Federal-interagency-thriving-communities-network 13 https://disposal.gsa.gov/s/PBC 16 U.S. General Services Administration its functions and works better for all Americans. As an example, Federal resources deployed to address immediate needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic faced challenges in equitably reaching communities who were already suffering from legacy disparities in and outcomes across race, class, and geography; these systemic inequities were further exacerbated by the pandemic.14 By conducting more frequent and rigorous evaluation of both the methods used to deliver government resources and the impacts of Federal programs on the public, the Federal Government has the potential to more fully understand if programs are working as intended, better interrupt bias further upstream and modernize systems for greater efficacy   with the ultimate goal of meeting the needs of communities, particularly the most vulnerable, when it matters the most. Undertaking evaluation can be expensive, time consuming, and may require Federal agencies to build capacity for data or research needs before being able to initiate this important work. Additionally, once evaluations are completed, Federal agencies face challenges with resources or infrastructure to act on key findings; and results from evaluations currently lack communication strategies that can more easily raise awareness for the public and catalyze implementation, including across non-Federal stakeholders who also benefit from these insights. Key Actions Complete, publish and share learnings from governmentwide equity evaluations. GSA serves a unique function in the government by providing other Federal agencies with help building and using evidence. We partner with Federal agencies to answer priority questions with rigorous evaluation methods and administrative data. We design and conduct evaluations of existing programs - including life-saving programs like disaster relief, emergency assistance, and crisis hotlines - and recommend evidence-based program changes, with the ultimate goal of improving how the government is serving all Americans.   Increase the number of Federal agencies and programs initiating equity evaluations. GSA currently partners with a handful of Federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Treasury and the U.S. Department of Education. GSA will increase its capacity for new evaluation agreements and work to recruit additional Federal agencies and programs to the service. Additionally, GSA will partner with the White House and interagency councils to bolster Federal agency capacity and readiness to undertake evaluations.   Conduct public engagement and increase awareness of equity evaluation findings. The conclusions and recommendations generated from these evaluation efforts are not only useful to the Federal Government. They provide important insights to State and local governments who coordinate downstream Federal resources to communities and act as a public accountability tool to the communities themselves. GSA will undertake a strategic communications campaign to raise awareness of key findings and ensure the research has maximum impact through its scaled application by end users. Measuring Our Progress: Equitable Administration of Government Programs GSA will know if we are effectively supporting positive change in Federal programs and the equitable delivery of government by several key factors, including:   number of Federal agencies and programs undertaking equity evaluations 14 How COVID-19 Has Magnified Pre-existing Inequalities in the US, Boston University (2022) 17   Number of Federal agencies and programs implementing updates based on findings increased number of people and communities reached by engagement and public   outreach actions about evaluation findings indicators of reduced burden and improved access where Federal program delivery has been revised based on evaluation findings   U.S. General Services Administration Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Economic Justice Strategy #5: Advance Equitable Access to Opportunity and Federal Resources for Local Communities and Minority Serving Institutions Barriers to Equity Rural, socioeconomically underserved, and historically disinvested communities, including Tribes and institutions that serve disadvantaged and minority populations like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), disproportionately rely on Federal goods and services to bridge critical resource gaps.15 Yet barriers to information, administrative burdens in navigating government processes, capacity and infrastructure gaps to meet government requirements, and equitable access to resource pathways prevent communities from fully realizing the available benefits from Federal support and partnership. Key Actions Deliver more Federal goods and products to American communities in critical need through the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program.16 Administered by GSA, the program enables certain non-Federal organizations to obtain personal property that the Federal Government no longer needs. This property includes computers, office equipment and furniture, motor vehicles, aircraft, vessels, scientific devices and heavy machinery. GSA facilitates the distribution of millions of dollars in surplus Federal goods annually and the program is administered in each of the 56 States and territories by a State Agency for Surplus Property (SASP). In addition, State agencies, cities, local governments, Tribal governments, and non-profit organizations for the purposes of public health or education or services to veterans may obtain Federal surplus personal property through the donation program. Examples of recipients of property donations include, but are not limited to: public works departments, public health departments, childcare centers, homeless shelters, school districts, food banks, and HBCUs or other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs).   Establish a plan to conduct proactive reviews for the 56 State Agencies for Surplus Property to ensure their compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with a goal of 14 SASPs for review each fiscal year. GSA s Office of Civil Rights is responsible for GSA s administration of Title VI and will work to increase equitable access to programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance from GSA. Initiate an engagement and outreach plan to raise awareness in local communities about resources available through their State Agency for Surplus Property. GSA   15 Public and Private Investments and Divestments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, American Council on Education (ACE), UNCF (2019) 16 GSA guide: Federal Personal Property for Reuse and Sale 18 will integrate technical assistance and public education about the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program alongside other regular community engagement efforts that the agency coordinates. U.S. General Services Administration Advance procurement opportunities and partnerships between Federal Agencies and Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions. HBCUs and MSIs provide vital support to communities through higher education, cutting edge research, public health ecosystems, pathways to quality employment, and well-being for economically and socially underserved Americans. The Federal Government can better benefit from the deep and rich expertise of these institutions and can improve pathways to more robust and meaningful partnership with them, including through Federal contracting.   Increase the number of eligible HBCUs and MSIs on the GSA Multiple Award Schedule. The MAS is a long-term contract with commercial entities that provides Federal agencies with billions of dollars in annual access to common products and services needed by the government. GSA plans to conduct outreach to eligible institutions currently without MAS contracts, conduct training and provide technical assistance on how to get on the MAS, and host HBCU-focused industry days, matchmaking events and other strategic engagements to raise awareness and help better position HBCUs and MSIs to successfully do business with the Federal Government   Launch and scale adoption of new GSA public digital resource for MSIs. GSA s new public website to support Minority Serving Institutions will aggregate information and resources that help both Federal agencies and MSIs develop and sustain partnerships or contracting agreements. Resources include market research, capabilities assessments, support for exploring joint venture and other contractor team agreements and data tools to help advance supplier diversity across Federal Government procurement Measuring Our Progress: Equitable Access to Federal Resources GSA will know if we are effectively supporting positive change in Federal programs and the equitable delivery of government by several key factors, including:   number of completed civil rights SASP compliance reviews   increased number of people, communities, and MSIs reached by engagement and public outreach actions increased number of underserved communities, organizations, or geographic areas that that seek to participate in the Federal surplus goods program indicators of reduced burden and improved access where program compliance reviews and any required updates have been implemented Increased number of MSI and HBCUs participating in Federal contracts Increased number of overall Federal contracting dollars obligated to MSIs and HBCUs         19",

Background. Lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American interests should not have access to our Nation s secrets, nor should their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts. My Administration must also take appropriate and nec- essary measures to guard against the actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that arise when the Government funds, engages with, or otherwise devotes resources to law firms and their clients that engage in conduct undermining critical American interests and priorities. I have determined that action is necessary to address the significant risks, egregious conduct, and conflicts of interest associated with Susman Godfrey LLP (Susman). Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections. Susman also funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military through the injection of political and radical ideology, and it supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race. Susman itself engages in unlawful discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race. For example, Susman administers a program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities only to  students of color.  My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimi- nation perpetrated in the name of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec. 2. Security Clearance Review. (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applica- ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Susman, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Susman. The heads of agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec. 3. Contracting. (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Susman and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with Susman or with entities that disclose doing business with Susman under subsection (a) of this section. To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall: VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:25 Apr 14, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\15APE0.SGM 15APE0 0 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l 15616 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 71 / Tuesday, April 15, 2025 / Presidential Documents (i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Susman has been hired to perform any service; and (ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Susman or with entities that do business with Susman effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. Sec. 4. Racial Discrimination. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP). Sec. 5. Personnel. (a) The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Susman when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Susman employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States. (b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Susman, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

      "phase1_response": "TO: GSA Leadership\nFROM: GSA Office of Policy Analysis\nDATE: April 16, 2025\nSUBJECT: Analysis of Executive Order 14263 on GSA Equity Action Plan\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of the recently issued Executive Order 14263, \"Addressing Risks From Susman Godfrey,\" and its potential impact on the GSA's 2023 Equity Action Plan.\n\n### 1. Summary of Policy Text: GSA Equity Action Plan Updates for 2023\n\nThe GSA Equity Action Plan is a high-level strategic document that codifies \"equity\" as a core element of the agency's overarching goal to deliver efficient and effective government services. It outlines GSA's commitment to being equitable, accessible, and inclusive. The plan, presented by Administrator Carnahan, emphasizes a \"people-centered approach\" to ensure government works for everyone. It frames GSA's key activities\u2014such as investing in American jobs, delivering digital services, and building a sustainable future\u2014through the lens of achieving meaningful equity impacts for communities across the country. The document is aspirational and sets a broad policy direction for the agency.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text: EO 14263\n\nExecutive Order 14263 is a directive focused specifically on the law firm Susman Godfrey LLP (\"Susman\"). The order states that this firm, and others like it, should not have access to federal contracts or funds due to alleged conduct that is detrimental to American interests. The EO accuses Susman of weaponizing the legal system, undermining elections, and engaging in and supporting unlawful discrimination on the basis of race. As a specific example, it cites a Susman program that allegedly offers financial awards and employment opportunities exclusively to \"students of color.\" The order directs the federal government to take measures to guard against conflicts of interest and cease subsidizing the firm. It also expresses the Administration's broader commitment to ending what it defines as unlawful discrimination perpetrated through certain \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" policies.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nThis Executive Order **does not directly apply** to the GSA Equity Action Plan as a policy document. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n*   **Specificity of the Executive Order:** EO 14263 is highly specific in its target. Its primary purpose is to prohibit the federal government from engaging with, funding, or contracting with a single named entity: Susman Godfrey LLP. It does not issue a broad prohibition on all equity-related initiatives across the government.\n*   **Nature of the GSA Policy:** The GSA Equity Action Plan is a statement of strategic intent and principles. It outlines goals like inclusivity, accessibility, and community investment. It does not prescribe specific programs, name external partners, or detail procurement actions. The plan's language is broad and does not contain any provisions that would inherently violate the EO. For example, it does not mandate the creation of programs that limit participation based on race, which is the specific type of action the EO condemns.\n*   **Distinction Between Policy and Implementation:** While the EO criticizes certain activities carried out in the name of \"diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" it does not invalidate the underlying principles of equity that GSA's plan espouses (e.g., ensuring services are accessible to all Americans). The EO would only become directly relevant to GSA's *actions* if GSA were to (1) attempt to contract with Susman Godfrey, or (2) implement a specific program under its Equity Action Plan that was found to be unlawfully discriminatory in the manner described by the EO. The plan itself does not mandate either of these actions.\n\nIn summary, the Executive Order is a directive concerning a specific external entity and a warning against specific, allegedly unlawful implementation methods. The GSA Equity Action Plan is a high-level internal strategy document that is not in conflict with the order as written.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nAlthough the policy document itself is not affected, GSA must take steps to ensure its *operations* are in compliance with the Executive Order. The following actions are recommended:\n\n1.  **Vendor and Contractor Review:** The Office of General Counsel (OGC) and the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) should immediately conduct a review of all current contracts, grants, and partnerships to confirm that GSA has no existing financial or contractual relationship with Susman Godfrey LLP.\n2.  **Update Procurement Guidance:** FAS should ensure that Susman Godfrey LLP is flagged in all relevant procurement and contracting systems to prevent any future awards, in accordance with the directive of EO 14263.\n3.  **Legal Review of Equity Plan Implementation:** As GSA develops and implements specific programs and initiatives under the Equity Action Plan, each initiative should undergo a thorough review by the OGC. This review will ensure that program designs and execution strategies are fully compliant with all federal laws and executive orders, including the principles regarding non-discrimination articulated in EO 14263.\n\nThese proactive steps will ensure GSA remains fully compliant with the executive directive while continuing to pursue the important mission outlined in our Equity Action Plan.\n\n---\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",

Its primary domain is ensuring that the GSA's operations\u2014including its procurement, contracting, and service delivery\u2014are equitable, accessible, and inclusive.

Its primary domain is ensuring that the GSA's operations\u2014including its procurement, contracting, and service delivery\u2014are equitable, accessible, and inclusive. The policy aims to embed equity as a core principle in how the GSA partners with industry and serves the American people.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:**\n    The executive order, \"Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey,\" operates in the domain of national security, federal contracting, and legal ethics. Its specific purpose is to prohibit federal agencies from providing funds, contracts, or access to classified information to law firms (specifically naming one) whose activities are deemed \"detrimental to critical American interests.\"\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:**\n    There is a **direct impact**. The GSA's Equity Action Plan is not just a statement of values; it is a plan that guides the agency's actions. A key part of the GSA's mission, as mentioned in the policy text, is \"partnering with American industry.\" This partnership is executed through federal contracts and other agreements.\n\n    The Executive Order imposes a specific, binding restriction on all federal agencies, including the GSA, regarding whom they can engage with for contracts and funding. It creates a new category of ineligibility for potential government partners based on national interest and security. Therefore, when the GSA implements its Equity Action Plan to create equitable partnerships, it must now do so within the new constraints established by this EO. The EO directly affects the pool of eligible partners the GSA can consider, thereby impacting the execution of its partnership and procurement strategies, which are central to the Equity Action Plan.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:**\n    *   **Policy Text:** The policy states GSA's role in \"...partnering with American industry...\" This shows that procurement and contracting are key areas for implementing the equity plan.\n    *   **EO Text:** The order explicitly states that certain law firms' conduct should not be \"subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts.\" It further directs the government to \"guard against...conflicts of interest that arise when the Government funds, engages with, or otherwise devotes resources to law firms...\"\n\n    The EO's prohibition on using \"Federal taxpayer funds or contracts\" for specific entities directly modifies the operational environment in which the GSA's policy on \"partnering with American industry\" must be carried out.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:**\n    One might argue that the documents are unrelated because their primary goals are different\u2014one is about promoting equity, while the other is about mitigating national security risks. The initial \"Not Affected\" flag likely resulted from this thematic-level assessment. However, this view overlooks the operational reality. A policy that guides a process (like the GSA's procurement strategy) is inherently affected by any new rule or law that changes the fundamental parameters of that process. The EO does not need to mention \"equity\" to affect an \"Equity Action Plan\"; it simply needs to impact the actions the plan governs. In this case, the EO introduces a mandatory exclusion criterion for federal contracting, which directly constrains the GSA's ability to partner with industry, a core tenet of its Equity Plan.",

Purpose. This Leasing Alert issues policy and guidance for incorporating electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) requirements into leases and Requests for Lease Proposals (RLPs). 2. Background. Per Executive Order 14057, Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability, all agency light-duty vehicle acquisitions must be zero-emission vehicles by the end of FY 2027. This requirement may necessitate the installation of EVSE as part of an agency s mission for normal operations. In October 2022, the Office of Leasing released preliminary internal guidance regarding EVSE and Leases. This Leasing Alert memorializes existing guidance, recommendations, and best practices surrounding the addition of EVSE into new and existing leases. 3. Effective Date. This Leasing Alert and attachments are effective immediately. 4. Applicability. This Leasing Alert applies to all General Services Administration (GSA) real property leasing activities that include requirements for Government- Owned Vehicles (GOVs), and to all those leasing activities delegated by GSA to other Federal agencies that include requirements for U.S. General Services Administration 1800 F Street, NW Washington, DC 20405-0002 www.gsa.gov 1 DocuSign Envelope ID: 6B5E0458-232E-4D7E-B338-8092B8ECA23C LA-23-08 Government-Owned Vehicles (GOVs). For information on guidance related to Personal Owned Vehicles, see Executive Order 14057. 5. Cancellation. None. 6. Instructions and Procedures. Instructions and procedures are outlined below. 7. Attachments. a. Attachment 1 - Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment Lease Amendment Template b. Attachment 2 - Statement of Work Template for EVSE Site Assessments c. Attachment 3 - CAAC Letter 2022-04 Supplement 1 Sample letter Approving Lessor use of FAS Schedule BPAs 8. Policy. a. General. i. The Lease Amendment should state the government s intention regarding the EVSE. If the Government chooses to remove the EVSE(s), the deinstallation must be done by a qualified contractor. ii. Within this policy,  agency  refers to the agency occupant of the Space. b. Adding EVSE to New or Existing Leases. i. EVSE requests for government-owned vehicles (GOVs) are considered tenant-specific improvements. The scope of tenant- specific improvements are not part of the lease template but are attached as an additional requirement of the lease (e.g.,  Special Requirements  exhibit). ii. EVSE requests should be requested by the tenant agency and will be addressed on a lease-by-lease basis depending on agency requirements, as: 1. Tenant improvements (TI) when the scope is associated with the procurement of a new lease; Page 2 of 17 DocuSign Envelope ID: 6B5E0458-232E-4D7E-B338-8092B8ECA23C LA-23-08 a. During the requirements development process and again when drafting the RLP, project teams should work with client agencies, using the Electric Vehicle the Suitability Assessment Tool, appropriate number of EVSEs that should be required as part of the lease procurement. to determine 2. Alterations when requested during the term of an existing lease; or 3. Agency equipment when GSA or the agency purchases an EVSE that is not connected to the building s electrical power and does not require installation or permanent attachment to the building. In these cases, the agency is responsible for all operations and maintenance. iii. Agencies should submit a written request of the EVSE requirement to their regional leasing point of contact (i.e., client planning manager, account manager, leasing specialist/LCO, Lease Acquisition Manager). In accordance with 40 U.S.C. (C) (4), a written determination must be made to set forth the circumstances that make the improvement advantageous and show that the total cost for the expected life of the lease is less than the cost of alternative space not needing repair, alteration, or improvement. For more information, consult Leasing Desk Guide Chapter 8, Section 2. iv. For delegated leases, agencies will pursue EVSE requirements in accordance with lease procurement or alteration requirements. v. Prior to any installation of EVSE as a lease alteration, a site assessment may need to be completed by a qualified professional to determine building load capacity, utility grid capacity, installation requirements, suggested physical location of charging units, etc. See Attachment 2 for a statement of work (SOW) template for EVSE site assessments that can be used for site assessment planning and gauging feasibility and pricing of EVSE projects. 1. Note. For larger installation projects, site assessments are strongly recommended. Page 3 of 17 DocuSign Envelope ID: 6B5E0458-232E-4D7E-B338-8092B8ECA23C LA-23-08 2. Note. Any costs associated with site assessments are agency-reimbursable. 3. Note. Site assessments should be completed through a lease amendment. If the lessor is unwilling to complete the site assessment, but is willing to allow GSA to complete the assessment, GSA s Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) should be used. For more information on the BPA, see GSA Fleet Management s page. vi. EVSEs being installed in leases as a TI or Alteration must have point- of-sale capability, access control, and GSA Fleet Wright Express, Inc.  (WEX card) capability. (Note: Point-of-sale capability allows the user to pay for their electricity with a card/app and prevents the administrative burden of annual RWAs to pay for electricity and periodic electrical usage reconciliation with the lessor.) It is recommended that the charger be able to track detailed usage. For more information on the GSA Fleet WEX Card, see Gsa.gov. c. Cybersecurity. EVSEs being installed in leases as TI or Alterations must meet cybersecurity requirements. The most efficient way to achieve this is to allow the Lessor access to the Federal Supply Schedules Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for EVSE purchases, as all EVSEs on the BPA have been reviewed and approved for government use. (See Supplement 1 to Class Deviation CD-2022-04). If the Lessor does not use equipment purchased through the BPA, they must use FEDRAMP approved or FEDRAMP sponsored equipment. If the lessor proposed equipment is not FEDRAMP approved or FEDRAMP sponsored, the customer agency must sponsor said equipment for FEDRAMP approval, including taking on the associated costs of that sponsorship, in order to use that equipment. i. Note: See Attachment #3 for CAAC Letter 2022-04 Supplement 1 to allow access to GSA BPA. ii. Note: For GSA delegated leases, use your agency s own review and approval process for EVSE equipment. d. Operations, Maintenance and Network Connectivity. Page 4 of 17 DocuSign Envelope ID: 6B5E0458-232E-4D7E-B338-8092B8ECA23C LA-23-08 i. If EVSE is being added as an alteration, the LCO must negotiate with the lessor and memorialize in a lease amendment which party is responsible for the EVSE charger s operation, maintenance, and replacement. (See Lease Amendment Template paragraphs 6 7) ii. If EVSE is part of the special requirements for the initial lease procurement, the LCO must specify in the lease which party is responsible for the operation, maintenance, replacement, and utilities of the charger. iii. Internet, wi-fi, and other network services may be included in standard operating costs, if they are necessary and incidental to EVSE chargers. LA-18-07, Payment for Extended, Multi-Shift, or Continuous Mission-Related Services in Leases promotes the inclusion of mission-related requirements for recurring utility services into a lease s operating rent. e. EVSE Considerations. i. Lease Terms. Prior to awarding any alterations project, leasing specialists should consider the number of years that are remaining under the current lease. The Government should avoid investing substantive lump sum funding in leases that are due to expire in the near future. As outlined in the Leasing Desk Guide Chapter 8 Alterations leasing specialists must give consideration to  early exercise of any existing renewal option, cancellation of the lease and procuring new space, acquiring a succeeding lease, or acquiring a superseding lease  before contracting for alterations. in Leased Space, ii. Prospectus Rates: The addition of EVSE operating costs into a rental agreement does not violate a fully authorized prospectus unless the approved rate for the prospectus is already inclusive of the specific services that are being added to the lease. For prospectus projects still under development, the proposed prospectus must account for the new EVSE requirement when setting a rent limitation. iii. Other Charging options: When EVSE installation is impractical or otherwise not possible, leasing specialists should work with the agency to suggest alternatives such as public charging stations, home-to-work charging, or hybrid vehicles that do not require a Page 5 of 17 DocuSign Envelope ID: 6B5E0458-232E-4D7E-B338-8092B8ECA23C LA-23-08 charging station. f. Parking and Accessibility. i. EVSEs intended solely for government use can only be installed in parking areas where GSA has a leasehold interest. For this reason, the Government can only pay for EVSE to be installed if a lease includes assigned parking space(s) reserved for the exclusive use of the Government. ii. All lease EVSE installations must conform to the U.S. Access Board s Guide to the ABA Accessibility Standards.

Background. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins, and has never been hacked. As a result of its scarcity and security, Bitcoin is often referred to as  digital gold . Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The United States Government currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a policy to maximize BTC s strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system. Just as it is in our country s interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United States Digital Asset Stockpile that can serve as a secure account for orderly and strategic management of the United States  other digital asset holdings. Sec. 3. Creation and Administration of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  Stra- tegic Bitcoin Reserve,  capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency (agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to sub- section (d) of this section (Government BTC). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Govern- ment BTC held by it to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. Government BTC deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law. (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  United States Digital Asset Stockpile,  capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Stockpile Assets).

      "Summary": "Policy Analysis Summary:\n\n1. Policy Text Summary:\nThe GSA Public Buildings Service Leasing Alert (LA-23-08) provides guidance for incorporating Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) requirements into government leases. The policy focuses on installing EV charging infrastructure for government-owned vehicles, with specific requirements around installation, cybersecurity, operations, and maintenance.\n\n2. Executive Order Text Summary:\nExecutive Order 14233 establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile, primarily focused on managing government-held digital assets like Bitcoin. The order directs federal agencies to review and potentially transfer digital assets to centralized government accounts.\n\n3. Applicability of Executive Order:\nThe executive order does NOT directly impact the EVSE leasing policy. The executive order is exclusively about digital asset management and does not contain provisions related to:\n- Electric vehicle infrastructure\n- Lease amendments\n- Government building services\n- Vehicle charging equipment\n\n4. Compliance and Next Steps:\nSince the executive order does not affect the EVSE leasing policy, no immediate action is required. The current EVSE leasing policy (LA-23-08) remains fully valid and operational.\n\nRecommendation: Continue implementing the EVSE leasing policy as originally designed. No modifications are necessary based on the recent executive order.\n\nCaveat: This analysis is based on the documents provided and represents a professional interpretation. Always consult legal counsel for definitive guidance.",

Summary of Policy Text (Leasing Alert LA-23-08)\nLeasing Alert LA-23-08, issued by the GSA's Office of Leasing on December 20, 2023, establishes policy and guidance for incorporating Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) into federal government leases and Requests for Lease Proposals (RLPs). The policy is a direct response to Executive Order 14057, which mandates that all new light-duty Government-Owned Vehicles (GOVs) be zero-emission by the end of fiscal year 2027. The alert's purpose is to ensure that GSA leasing activities can support this vehicle fleet transition by providing the necessary charging infrastructure in leased properties.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text (EO 14233)\nExecutive Order 14233, \"Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,\" dated March 6, 2025, outlines a new federal policy regarding digital assets. It directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish two new entities: a \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\" to manage the government's Bitcoin holdings as a strategic asset, and a \"United States Digital Asset Stockpile\" for other digital assets. The EO's focus is on financial policy, national economic strategy, and the management of intangible digital assets forfeited to or held by the U.S. government.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\nThis executive order **does not apply** to GSA Leasing Alert LA-23-08. The two documents operate in entirely separate and unrelated policy domains.\n\n*   **Disparate Subject Matter:** The GSA policy concerns physical infrastructure and real property management. Its focus is on the tangible assets (EV chargers) required to support another set of tangible assets (government vehicles) within leased federal building spaces. In contrast, the executive order concerns national financial policy and the management of intangible, digital assets like cryptocurrency.\n*   **No Overlapping Mandates:** The executive order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish and administer financial reserves. It contains no provisions, instructions, or implications for the General Services Administration, the Public Buildings Service, real property leasing, or federal vehicle fleet management. The GSA policy is an internal operational directive for leasing officials to implement a pre-existing sustainability mandate (from EO 14057), which is unrelated to the financial directives in EO 14233.\n\nIn short, there is no functional connection between the management of the nation's strategic Bitcoin reserve and the GSA's procedures for installing electric vehicle chargers in its leased properties.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\nAs the executive order has no bearing on the GSA leasing policy, no actions are required to achieve compliance. GSA leasing personnel should continue to follow the guidance outlined in Leasing Alert LA-23-08 without modification.\n\n---\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",

Specifically, it provides guidance from the General Services Administration (GSA) on how to incorporate requirements for Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), or charging stations, into federal building leases to support the government's transition to a zero-emission vehicle fleet.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, \"Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,\" operates in the domain of **National Economic and Financial Policy**. Its focus is on cryptocurrency and digital assets, specifically directing the creation of a national strategic reserve of Bitcoin (BTC) to secure a strategic advantage in the global financial system.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** There is no direct or indirect impact from the executive order on the policy. The two documents are entirely unrelated in their subject matter, objectives, and the agencies they affect.\n    *   **Direct Impact:** The order makes no mention of government leasing, vehicles, energy, or physical infrastructure. It does not amend, rescind, or create any authorities or requirements that would alter how the GSA manages its leasing program for EVSE.\n    *   **Indirect Impact:** There is no plausible indirect connection. The policy is operational, dealing with the logistics of installing physical equipment in buildings. The order is strategic and financial, dealing with the acquisition and management of intangible digital assets. The successful implementation of one does not depend on or influence the other.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:** The disconnect is evident in the key terminology of each document:\n    *   **Policy Key Language:** \"Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE),\" \"leases,\" \"Requests for Lease Proposals (RLPs),\" \"zero-emission vehicles,\" \"GSA Public Buildings Service.\"\n    *   **Executive Order Key Language:** \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,\" \"Digital Asset Stockpile,\" \"cryptocurrency,\" \"digital gold,\" \"global financial system.\"\n    The language used in each document clearly delineates two separate and non-overlapping areas of government activity.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** The only commonality is that both are federal government directives. However, this is a superficial connection. The policy is an internal GSA alert implementing a previously established sustainability goal (from EO 14057), while the executive order establishes a new national financial strategy. They operate in parallel universes of government function. The initial assessment of \"Not Affected\" is correct and well-founded.",

Background. America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nation s economic prosperity. In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regula- tions have impeded the development of these resources, limited the genera- tion of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens. These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utili- ties, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security. It is thus in the national interest to unleash America s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity includ- ing for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years. It will also rebuild our Nation s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States: (a) to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future; (b) to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states; (c) to protect the United States s economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation; (d) to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law; (e) to eliminate the  electric vehicle (EV) mandate  and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable; (f) to safeguard the American people s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries; (g) to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action shall, whenever evaluated, be reported separately from its domestic costs and VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4 8 C O D S E R P h t i w D O R P 4 4 1 S 7 W 9 K S D n o d n o m m a h k 8354 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents benefits, in order to promote sound regulatory decision making and prioritize the interests of the American people; (h) to guarantee that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, peer-reviewed sci- entific analysis; and (i) to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required by law. Sec. 3. Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Development of Domestic Energy Resources. (a) The heads of all agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agen- cy actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources  with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources or that are otherwise incon- sistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restric- tions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances. (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law. The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section. (c) Agencies shall promptly notify the Attorney General of any steps taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section so that the Attorney General may, as appropriate: (i) provide notice of this Executive Order and any such actions to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation in which such actions may be relevant; and (ii) request that such court stay or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the com- pletion of the administrative actions described in this order. (d) Pursuant to the policy outlined in section 2 of this order, the Attorney General shall consider whether pending litigation against illegal, dangerous, or harmful policies should be resolved through stays or other relief.

(d) The head of any agency that has taken action respecting offices and programs in subsection (a) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all such actions are terminated or, if necessary, appropriate, or required by law, that such activities are transitioned to other agencies or entities. (e) Any contract or agreement between the United States and any third party on behalf of the entities or programs abolished in subsection (a) of this section, or in furtherance of them, shall be terminated for convenience, or otherwise, as quickly as permissible under the law. Sec. 5. Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting. (a) Execu- tive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality) is hereby revoked. (b) To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and propose rescinding CEQ s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq. (c) Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall convene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level imple- menting regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118 5). Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process. (d) The Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule.

Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects. (e) The Director of the NEC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare recommendations to Congress, which shall: (i) facilitate the permitting and construction of interstate energy transpor- tation and other critical energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pipelines, particularly in regions of the Nation that have lacked such development in recent years; and (ii) provide greater certainty in the Federal permitting process, including, but not limited to, streamlining the judicial review of the application of NEPA. Sec. 6. Prioritizing Accuracy in Environmental Analyses. (a) In all Federal permitting adjudications or regulatory processes, all agencies shall adhere to only the relevant legislated requirements for environmental considerations and any considerations beyond these requirements are eliminated. In ful- filling all such requirements, agencies shall strictly use the most robust methodologies of assessment at their disposal and shall not use methodolo- gies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated. (b) The Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which was established pursuant to Executive Order 13990, is hereby disbanded, and any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy including: (i) the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policy- making); (ii) the Report of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Inter- agency Working Group of November 2023 (National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Informa- tion System); (iii) the Technical Support Document of February 2021 (Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990); and (iv) estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases, including the estimates for the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, or the social cost of nitrous oxide based, in whole or in part, on the IWG s work or guidance. (c) The calculation of the  social cost of carbon  is marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation. Its abuse arbitrarily slows regulatory decisions and, by rendering the United States economy internationally uncompetitive, encourages a greater human impact on the environment by affording less efficient foreign energy producers a greater share of the global energy and natural resource market. Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA shall issue guidance to address these harmful and detrimental inadequacies, including consideration of eliminating the  social cost of carbon  calculation from any Federal permitting or regu- latory decision. (d) Prior to the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, agencies shall ensure estimates to assess the value of changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from agency actions, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international effects and evaluating appro- priate discount rates, are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A 4 of September 17, 2003 (Regu- latory Analysis). (e) Furthermore, the head of each agency shall, as appropriate and con- sistent with applicable law, initiate a process to make such changes to VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4 8 C O D S E R P h t i w D O R P 4 4 1 S 7 W 9 K S D n o d n o m m a h k Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents 8357 any rule, regulation, policy or action as may be necessary to ensure consist- ency with the Regulatory Analysis. (f) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA, in collaboration with the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit joint recommendations to the Director of OMB on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator s findings,  Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,  Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009). Sec. 7. Terminating the Green New Deal. (a) All agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117 169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117 58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and shall review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disburse- ments of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agency heads shall submit a report to the Director of the NEC and Director of OMB that details the findings of this review, including recommendations to enhance their alignment with the policy set forth in section 2. No funds identified in this subsection (a) shall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt. (b) When procuring goods and services, making decisions about leases, and making other arrangements that result in disbursements of Federal funds, agencies shall prioritize cost-effectiveness, American workers and businesses, and the sensible use of taxpayer money, to the greatest extent. The Director of OMB shall finalize and circulate guidelines to further implement this subsection. (c) All agencies shall assess whether enforcement discretion of authorities and regulations can be utilized to advance the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB identifying any such instances. Sec. 8. Protecting America s National Security. (a) The Secretary of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible, consistent with applicable law. In assessing the  Public Interest  to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employ- ment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application. (b) With respect to any proposed deepwater port for the export of liquefied natural gas (project) for which a favorable record of decision (ROD) has previously been issued pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), 33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq., the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall, within 30 days of the date of this order and consistent with applicable law, determine whether any refinements to the project pro- posed subsequent to the ROD are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that substantially differ from those associated with the origi- nally-evaluated project so as to present a seriously different picture of the foreseeable adverse environmental consequences (seriously different con- sequences). In making this determination, MARAD shall qualitatively assess any difference in adverse environmental consequences between the project with and without the proposed refinements, including any potential con- sequences not addressed in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which shall be considered adequate under NEPA notwithstanding any revi- sions to NEPA that may have been enacted following the final EIS. MARAD shall submit this determination, together with a detailed justification, to the Secretary of Transportation and to the President.

(d) If MARAD determines, with concurrence from the Secretary of Trans- portation, that such proposed refinements are likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall, within 60 days after submitting such deter- mination, issue an Environmental Assessment (EA) examining such con- sequences and, with respect to all other environmental consequences not changed due to project refinements, shall reaffirm the conclusions of the final EIS. Within 30 days after issuing the EA, MARAD shall issue an addendum to the ROD, if necessary, and shall, within 30 additional days, issue a DWPA license consistent with the ROD. Sec. 9. Restoring America s Mineral Dominance. (a) The Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the EPA, Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise or rescind such actions. (b) The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture shall reassess any public lands withdrawals for potential revision. (c) The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.

      "phase1_response": "TO: GSA Leadership\nFROM: Policy Analysis Division\nDATE: January 30, 2025\nSUBJECT: Analysis of Executive Order 14154 and its Impact on GSA Order PBS 1098.1 (Sustainability Performance)\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of the newly issued Executive Order 14154, \"Unleashing American Energy,\" and its direct impact on GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) Order 1098.1, \"Sustainability Performance.\"\n\n### 1. Summary of Policy Text (GSA Order PBS 1098.1)\n\nGSA Order PBS 1098.1, issued on January 11, 2023, establishes a comprehensive sustainability policy for GSA's real property portfolio. The Order's primary objectives are to reduce the environmental footprint and operating costs of federal buildings. Key goals include reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, and water usage; increasing the number of all-electric and net-zero energy buildings; mandating the purchase of carbon pollution-free electricity; and ultimately achieving portfolio-wide net-zero operational emissions by 2045. The policy prioritizes environmental stewardship and long-term sustainability performance.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order (EO 14154)\n\nExecutive Order 14154, \"Unleashing American Energy,\" issued on January 20, 2025, establishes a new federal policy focused on maximizing domestic energy production to ensure energy affordability, reliability, and national security. The EO directs federal agencies to encourage energy exploration and production, framing previous sustainability-focused regulations as \"burdensome and ideologically motivated.\" The core policy is to ensure an abundant supply of reliable and affordable energy for American citizens and industries, thereby reducing costs and strengthening the nation's economic and military standing.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nExecutive Order 14154 applies directly to and is in significant conflict with the directives and goals of GSA Order PBS 1098.1. While the EO does not explicitly name GSA or this specific policy, its government-wide mandate to prioritize affordable and reliable energy over other considerations creates a fundamental clash with the GSA Order's sustainability-focused objectives.\n\nThe key points of conflict are:\n\n*   **Conflicting Priorities:** PBS 1098.1 prioritizes GHG reduction, carbon-free electricity, and the transition to all-electric buildings. EO 14154 prioritizes cost reduction, energy abundance, and reliability, implicitly favoring traditional and fossil-fuel energy sources that are often the cheapest and most readily available.\n*   **Procurement and Energy Sourcing:** PBS 1098.1 directs PBS to purchase \"Carbon Pollution-Free Electricity.\" EO 14154's emphasis on low-cost, reliable energy will make it difficult to justify paying a premium for renewable energy sources if a cheaper, fossil-fuel-generated alternative is available. Contracting officers would be caught between the GSA Order's mandate and the President's overarching policy directive.\n*   **Building Design and Construction:** The goal in PBS 1098.1 to increase \"all-electric buildings\" and \"net-zero energy\" facilities often involves higher upfront capital investments and reliance on an electricity grid that the EO may seek to support with fossil fuels. The EO\u2019s framework could be used to challenge these investments as not being cost-effective or contributing to the primary goal of affordability.\n*   **Policy Interpretation:** The EO describes regulations aimed at sustainability as \"burdensome.\" This sets a new interpretive lens through which all agency policies, including PBS 1098.1, will be viewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and other oversight bodies. Programs and goals derived from PBS 1098.1 are now vulnerable to being labeled \"burdensome\" and targeted for revision or elimination.\n\nAs an executive branch agency, GSA is required to align its policies and operations with the directives set forth by the President. Therefore, the conflicting nature of these two documents means that PBS 1098.1 cannot be implemented in its current form without violating the spirit and likely the letter of the new Executive Order.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nGiven the direct conflict, GSA must take immediate steps to address the new policy landscape created by EO 14154. Recommended actions include:\n\n1.  **Immediate Policy Review:** The Office of General Counsel and the Office of Government-wide Policy should conduct a formal review of PBS 1098.1 to identify all specific provisions that are in direct conflict with EO 14154.\n2.  **Issue Interim Guidance:** GSA should promptly issue interim guidance to all PBS regions and contracting officers. This guidance should pause the implementation of conflicting provisions, such as mandates for purchasing premium-cost carbon-free electricity or exclusive requirements for all-electric systems, pending a full policy revision. The guidance should instruct staff to prioritize energy cost, reliability, and security in all new procurement and design decisions, in alignment with the EO.\n3.  **Revise or Rescind PBS 1098.1:** The long-term solution requires a formal revision of PBS 1098.1. The revised order must subordinate sustainability goals to the EO's primary objectives of energy affordability and reliability. This may involve replacing hard targets (e.g., \"net zero by 2045\") with more flexible language (e.g., \"pursue cost-effective energy efficiency measures\").\n4.  **Budget Reassessment:** Review all planned and ongoing projects initiated under PBS 1098.1. Budgets and plans may need to be adjusted to reflect the new priorities, potentially shifting funds from sustainability-specific initiatives to those that enhance energy reliability or reduce direct utility costs.\n\nFinal Determination: Affected",

Its primary objectives are to improve the environmental performance of public buildings by reducing energy and water consumption, minimizing waste and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and actively transitioning the portfolio towards all-electric and net-zero energy buildings, with a clear goal of achieving net-zero operational emissions by 2045.\n\n2.  **Executive Order Domain/Subject Area:** The executive order, EO 14154, \"Unleashing American Energy,\" operates in the domain of national energy policy. Its stated purpose is to increase domestic energy production by removing what it characterizes as \"burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations.\" The EO prioritizes the generation of \"affordable and reliable\" energy to lower costs for consumers and businesses, directly opposing policies that it views as impeding resource development.\n\n3.  **Detailed Impact Analysis:** There is a direct and significant conflict between the objectives of the GSA policy and the executive order. The GSA policy is an implementation of a federal strategy focused on decarbonization and energy efficiency. The executive order establishes a new, opposing federal strategy that prioritizes energy production and deregulation over sustainability goals.\n\n    *   **Direct Conflict of Goals:** The policy's mandate to \"reduce energy use\" and \"reduce...greenhouse gas emissions\" is fundamentally at odds with the EO's aim to \"unleash American energy\" by removing regulations. The policy's push for \"all-electric buildings\" and \"net zero operational emissions\" would likely be viewed as the type of \"burdensome\" regulation the EO seeks to eliminate, as these initiatives can have upfront costs and restrict the types of energy sources used in federal buildings.\n    *   **Hierarchical Authority:** As an executive order from the President, EO 14154 sets the overarching policy direction for the entire executive branch. The General Services Administration (GSA) is an executive agency and is therefore required to align its internal orders and operations with the President's directives. GSA would be compelled to review, and likely revise or rescind, PBS 1098.1 to ensure its compliance with the new national energy policy priorities.\n\n4.  **Key Language Supporting Determination:** The conflict is evident in the key terminology of each document:\n    *   **Policy (PBS 1098.1):** Keywords include \"Sustainability Performance,\" \"reduce energy use,\" \"reduce...greenhouse gas emissions,\" \"all-electric buildings,\" and \"net zero operational emissions by 2045.\" This language reflects a clear commitment to environmental and climate-related goals.\n    *   **Executive Order (EO 14154):** Key phrases include \"Unleashing American Energy,\" \"burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations,\" and \"affordable and reliable energy.\" This language signals a clear intent to reverse policies perceived as prioritizing environmental ideology over economic and energy production goals.\n\n5.  **Nuances and Considerations:** While the executive order does not specifically name GSA or this particular policy, its scope is intentionally broad. It targets the foundational principles upon which the GSA sustainability policy is built. The impact is not indirect or incidental; the EO is designed to change the entire regulatory environment in which the GSA policy operates. The GSA policy represents a specific implementation of a federal approach that the EO directly aims to dismantle. Therefore, the policy is unequivocally affected by the EO.",

Instructions and Procedures 8.A. SPE Acquisition Review Briefing (ARB) Request 8.A.1 When To Conduct an ARB An ARB with the SPE must be conducted as early in the acquisition life cycle as possible (e.g. market research phase) to identify any issues up front and to help expedite the final approval . The ARB should occur prior to the preparation of the document that will need the SPE s signature. 8.A.2 Preparing for the ARB The ARBs should focus on high-level considerations, covering the topics identified at GSAM 504.7102(d). The contracting activity shall prepare slides in advance in Google slides using this ARB Template . Do not edit the template. Instead, make a copy of the template. Since the slides will be shared with the SPE in advance, the contracting activity should not expect to read the slides during the ARB. Rather, the contracting activity should expect a dialogue with the SPE. PIB 21-04 2 The contracting activity shall mark presentation slides with source selection information in accordance with FAR Subpart 3.104-4(c). The ARB will be scheduled for one hour . Attachment 1 identifies the individuals who will be invited to the ARB. 8.A.3 How to Request an ARB When a contracting activity has identified the need for an ARB with the SPE, they shall submit an email to the PBS Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) Policy and Programs Division (PQA), at pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov with the following information: (1) Description of the need for SPE involvement (e.g., SPE approval of a consolidation determination); (2) Description of the requirement, including key milestones (e.g., anticipated solicitation date, anticipated award date); (3) Suggested date(s) of acquisition review(s); (4) ARB slides ( in Google slides using this ARB Template ); (5) A list of regional attendees (see Attachment 1 for attendee list); and (6) Any other important information. Requests to OAM for an ARB with the SPE should be made at least fifteen business days prior to the suggested date of the ARB. Within five business days of receiving the request, OAM will:   Send an email to spe.request@gsa.gov with the information contained in GSAM 504.7104(b);   Send out a calendar invitation for the ARB to all required and optional attendees; and   Coordinate with Central Office OGC on review and comments, and provide any comments to the contracting activity. All of the information provided, including the slides, will be reviewed by OAM prior to sharing with the SPE. Once any comments have been addressed, OAM will add the slides and any draft documents to the calendar invitation. Draft documents are not required for an ARB, and any draft documents provided will still need to go through a formal SPE review and approval process after the ARB. PIB 21-04 3 8.A.4 Special Considerations for Consolidation and Bundling Determinations Consolidation and Bundling Determinations require an understanding of the consolidation and bundling process, understanding of a  new requirement  , 1 in-depth market research, early coordination with the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), and an analysis of cost savings prior to the scheduling of an ARB with the SPE. See Attachment 2 for best practices for consolidation and bundling determination reviews. 8.A.5 ARB Summary Within five business days after the ARB, OAM will provide a summary to all attendees that will include any recommendations and action items. 8.B. SPE Final Document Approval 8.B.1 OAM Routing Following the SPE ARB, after a contracting activity has prepared the document requiring SPE review and received all regional-level concurrences, they shall submit the document for OAM review to pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov with the following information: (1) Description of the requirement, action required, and due date; (2) Separate the signature page from the rest of the document. This will allow changes to be made without having to go through the entire signature approval process again; Unless there are significant changes ( e.g., changes that materially impact the acquisition strategy and opportunities relating to small business, competition, category management) , documents do not always have to be rerouted for signature. Provided as an attachment to this PIB is a document routing template that can be modified and used, as appropriate; however, a signed pdf should be submitted; 1 To determine if the expansion or modification of an existing requirement would be considered a  new  requirement, several factors must be considered: (1) Whether the scope has changed significantly, requiring different types of work or capabilities; (2) Whether the magnitude or value of the requirement has changed significantly, such as greater than 25 percent; (3) Whether the end use of the requirement has changed; and (4) Whether the requirements have meaningfully changed, such as new technical specifications, different delivery schedules, or new performance locations.  New  requirements would not have been previously provided and would not meet the definition of consolidation or bundling; therefore, new requirements do not require a written determination. See Consolidation and Bundling FAQs for additional information. PIB 21-04 4 (3) Share the main body of the document as a Google document to enable reviewers to easily enter comments or suggested edits (or utilize a comment matrix if more practical for the circumstances and document type(s)) ; (4) Supporting attachments, if applicable; (5) Any other important information. OAM will coordinate with the Central Office OGC on review and comments, and will provide any comments to the contracting activity within five business days of receiving the information. Once comments from OAM/OGC have been addressed (if any), OAM/OGC will sign the document and OAM will return the document to the contracting activity. 8.B.2 SPE Routing The contracting activity shall follow the procedures in GSAM 504.7104(c) and OGP s Step 2 - Final Document Approval and submit the required email to the SPE at spe.request@gsa.gov and, if necessary, OSDBU at osdbu_review_concurrence@gsa.gov with a carbon copy to OAM at pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov . 9. Point of Contact Any questions regarding the PIB may be addressed to the PBS Office of Acquisition Management at pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov . 10.

Purpose and Policy. The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government. The injection of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  (DEI) into our institutions has corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy. Orders to open the borders have endangered the American people and dissolved Federal, State, and local resources that should be used to benefit the American people. Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation. To commence the policies that will make our Nation united, fair, safe, and prosperous again, it is the policy of the United States to restore common sense to the Federal Government and unleash the potential of the American citizen. The revocations within this order will be the first of many steps the United States Federal Government will take to repair our institutions and our economy. Sec. 2. Revocation of Orders and Actions. The following executive actions are hereby revoked: (a) Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Govern- ment).

      "Summary": "Policy Analysis Summary:\n\n1. Policy Text Summary:\nThe PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin (PIB) 21-04 provides guidance on the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval process for GSA Public Buildings Service acquisitions. It outlines procedures for:\n- Requesting Acquisition Review Briefings (ARBs)\n- Submitting documents for SPE approval\n- Specific review requirements for actions like class deviations, consolidation/bundling determinations, and competition justifications\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nThe Executive Order is a comprehensive rescission of numerous previous executive orders, with a particular focus on:\n- Eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives\n- Revoking executive actions related to various policy areas\n- Directing federal agencies to stop implementing what the order describes as \"unlawful and radical DEI ideology\"\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order does NOT directly impact the substantive procurement procedures outlined in the PBS PIB 21-04. The policy is a technical procurement guidance document focused on administrative review processes, which does not appear to be targeted by the executive order's DEI-related rescissions.\n\n4. Compliance Recommendations:\n- No immediate action is required to modify the PIB\n- Continue following existing procurement review procedures\n- Monitor future guidance from GSA leadership regarding potential procedural changes\n- Maintain standard procurement practices that focus on merit, competition, and regulatory compliance\n\nDisclaimer: This analysis is a professional interpretation and should not be considered definitive legal guidance. Organizations should consult their legal counsel for comprehensive compliance assessments.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this analysis?",

      "phase1_response": "TO: GSA Leadership\nFROM: Policy Analyst, Office of Acquisition Management\nDATE: January 29, 2025\nSUBJECT: Analysis of Executive Order 14148 on PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of the potential impact of Executive Order (EO) 14148 on the GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) Procurement Instructional Bulletin (PIB) 21-04.\n\n### 1. Summary of Policy Text\nPBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04 is an internal GSA policy document that provides procedural guidance for the acquisition workforce. Its purpose is to clarify when certain contract actions require the review and approval of the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE). The bulletin specifies four common instances: Class Deviations from acquisition regulations, Consolidation and Bundling determinations, high-value Justifications for Other Than Full and Open Competition (over $75 million), and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) waivers. The policy is administrative in nature, focusing on internal approval workflows and thresholds based on existing federal acquisition regulations (FAR and GSAM).\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text\nExecutive Order 14148, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions,\" is a presidential directive that states a policy of reversing actions from the previous administration. The EO specifically targets policies related to \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI), immigration, and \"climate extremism.\" The direct action of the EO is the immediate revocation of three specific prior executive orders: EO 13985 (Advancing Racial Equity), EO 13986 (Census), and EO 13987 (COVID-19 Response).\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\nThis executive order **does not directly apply to or affect** PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n*   **Mismatch in Subject Matter:** The PIB is a purely procedural document concerned with internal GSA approval authorities for standard procurement actions. The EO is a high-level, substantive policy document aimed at changing the government's direction on specific policy areas like DEI, climate, and equity. The PIB does not contain any language or mandates related to these topics.\n*   **No Link to Revoked Orders:** The authorities cited in the PIB are derived from the General Services Administration Acquisition Manual (GSAM) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). These are long-standing regulatory frameworks for federal procurement. The PIB does not derive its authority from, nor does it implement, any of the executive orders that were explicitly revoked by EO 14148 (EO 13985, EO 13986, EO 13987).\n*   **Procedural vs. Substantive:** The actions requiring SPE approval under the PIB (e.g., bundling analysis, non-competitive justifications) are standard, fiscally-driven procurement mechanisms that exist independent of the policy priorities targeted by the new EO. For example, a justification for a sole-source contract over $75 million requires SPE approval regardless of whether the procurement is for office furniture or for services related to a since-rescinded equity initiative. The approval process itself remains unchanged.\n\nWhile the broader policy shift signaled by EO 14148 may lead to future changes in GSA's acquisition priorities or even future regulatory updates, this specific EO does not create a conflict with or necessitate any change to the internal approval processes outlined in PIB 21-04.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\nAs the policy is not affected by the executive order, no immediate changes to PIB 21-04 are required for compliance.\n\n*   **No Action Required:** There is no need to rescind, revise, or reissue PIB 21-04 as a direct result of EO 14148.\n*   **Monitoring:** The Office of Acquisition Management should continue to monitor for any subsequent implementing guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) or changes to the FAR that may arise from the administration's new policy directives. However, based on the text of this EO alone, this PIB remains fully in effect and unchanged.\n\n***\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",

      "phase2_justification": "1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:** The policy, \"PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04,\" is squarely in the domain of **federal government procurement and contracting procedures**. It is a highly specific, internal GSA document that outlines the administrative process for obtaining review and approval from the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) for certain contract actions. Its focus is on the \"how\" of the approval process, not the substantive \"what\" or \"why\" of the contracts themselves.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions,\" is a high-level, politically-driven directive aimed at reversing the substantive policies of a previous administration.

It is a highly specific, internal GSA document that outlines the administrative process for obtaining review and approval from the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) for certain contract actions. Its focus is on the \"how\" of the approval process, not the substantive \"what\" or \"why\" of the contracts themselves.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions,\" is a high-level, politically-driven directive aimed at reversing the substantive policies of a previous administration. Its domains are explicitly stated as **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), immigration/border security, and climate change regulations**.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:**\n    *   **Direct Impact:** There is no direct impact. The executive order does not mention the General Services Administration (GSA), the Public Buildings Service (PBS), the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE), or the General Services Administration Acquisition Manual (GSAM). It makes no attempt to alter, rescind, or amend any specific procurement procedures.\n    *   **Indirect Impact:** The policy is a procedural framework. It dictates the steps to follow when SPE approval is required. The EO targets substantive policies (e.g., a requirement to consider climate impact or DEI in contracting). While the rescission of those substantive policies might reduce the *number* or *types* of contracts that are routed through the SPE approval process, it does not affect the procedural bulletin itself. The bulletin would remain the valid and correct procedure for any other contract action that still requires SPE approval. The process document is agnostic to the underlying policy goals of the contracts it governs.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:**\n    *   **Policy Text:** The purpose is to \"provide guidance on requesting Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval of certain contract actions.\" This language confirms its role as a procedural guide.\n    *   **EO Text:** The EO focuses on broad policy themes, citing the \"injection of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' (DEI),\" \"orders to open the borders,\" and \"climate extremism.\" This language is aimed at overturning substantive policy goals, not administrative processes. The EO does not contain any language related to contracting mechanisms or approval workflows.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** One might argue that if the *only* reason for this specific bulletin's existence was to process DEI-related contract deviations, then the EO would make it obsolete. However, the policy text cites \"Class Deviations - Class deviations to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)\" as a common example. This is a broad category of procurement action that extends far beyond the specific policy areas targeted by the EO. Therefore, the bulletin retains its relevance and function for numerous other procurement scenarios, and is not affected by the order.",

Purpose and Policy. The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government. The injection of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  (DEI) into our institutions has corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy. Orders to open the borders have endangered the American people and dissolved Federal, State, and local resources that should be used to benefit the American people. Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation. To commence the policies that will make our Nation united, fair, safe, and prosperous again, it is the policy of the United States to restore common sense to the Federal Government and unleash the potential of the American citizen. The revocations within this order will be the first of many steps the United States Federal Government will take to repair our institutions and our economy. Sec. 2. Revocation of Orders and Actions.

      "Summary": "Here's a comprehensive policy analysis:\n\n1. Policy Summary (GSA Order ADM 1100.1):\nThe policy focuses on GSA's response to the climate crisis, specifically:\n- Achieving net zero operational and procurement-related carbon emissions\n- Adapting GSA facilities, operations, and supply chains to withstand climate conditions\n- Implementing Executive Order 14057's sustainability goals, including:\n  * 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030\n  * 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035\n  * Net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045\n  * 65% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030\n\n2. Executive Order Summary (Executive Order 14148):\nThe order systematically revokes numerous previous executive orders, including:\n- Executive Order 14057 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability)\n- Executive Order 14008 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad)\n- Several other climate and sustainability-related executive orders\n\n3. Policy Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order directly impacts GSA Order ADM 1100.1 by:\n- Revoking the foundational Executive Order 14057\n- Effectively nullifying the legal basis for the current climate crisis response policy\n- Signaling a potential complete reversal of previous climate-focused federal policies\n\n4. Recommended Compliance Steps:\n- Immediately pause implementation of current climate sustainability initiatives\n- Await specific guidance from senior leadership\n- Prepare to potentially redesign or suspend the current climate response framework\n- Maintain existing infrastructure and operational capabilities\n- Develop contingency plans for potential policy restructuring\n\nCaveat: As an AI assistant, I recommend that GSA legal and policy teams conduct a thorough, official review of the executive order's implications and provide authoritative guidance.",

      "phase1_response": "To: GSA Leadership\nFrom: Policy Analysis Division\nDate: January 28, 2025\nSubject: Analysis of GSA Order ADM 1100.1 in light of Executive Order 14148\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of GSA Order ADM 1100.1, \"Prioritizing GSA Response to the Climate Crisis,\" following the issuance of Executive Order 14148, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions.\"\n\n### 1. Summary of GSA Policy ADM 1100.1\n\nGSA Order ADM 1100.1, signed January 25, 2023, establishes the implementation framework for GSA's strategy to address the climate crisis. Its primary purpose is to guide the agency toward achieving net-zero operational and procurement-related carbon emissions and ensuring GSA's assets and supply chains are resilient to climate change. The policy explicitly states that it is based on the authorities and goals outlined in Executive Order 14057, \"Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability,\" including goals for carbon-free electricity, zero-emission vehicles, and net-zero buildings.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order 14148\n\nExecutive Order (E.O.) 14148, signed January 20, 2025, serves to revoke several executive actions from the previous administration. Its stated policy is to counter what it defines as \"climate extremism,\" which it claims has \"exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation.\" The E.O. signals a significant shift in the administration's priorities, aiming to \"restore common sense to the Federal Government.\" While it explicitly revokes E.O. 13985 (Racial Equity), E.O. 13986 (Census), and E.O. 13987 (COVID-19), it also states that these revocations are the \"first of many steps\" to repair government institutions.\n\n### 3. Applicability of Executive Order to GSA Policy\n\nThis executive order **applies to and significantly affects** GSA Order ADM 1100.1. The analysis is as follows:\n\n*   **Underlying Authority:** GSA Order ADM 1100.1 is not a standalone policy; its \"Background\" section explicitly identifies E.O. 14057 as its primary authority and directive. The GSA Order is fundamentally an implementation plan for E.O. 14057.\n*   **Conflict in Stated Policy:** Section 1 of E.O. 14148 directly contradicts the purpose of GSA Order ADM 1100.1. E.O. 14148 frames federal climate initiatives as \"climate extremism\" that creates regulatory burdens. GSA Order ADM 1100.1 is a prime example of such a climate initiative, establishing a framework for emissions reduction and climate adaptation across GSA's portfolio. The new E.O. creates a hostile policy environment for the GSA Order's objectives.\n*   **Implied vs. Explicit Revocation:** While the provided text of E.O. 14148 does not explicitly list E.O. 14057 for revocation, it establishes a new governing policy that is fundamentally at odds with it. The statement that this is the \"first of many steps\" strongly suggests that related orders, such as E.O. 14057, are targeted for future rescission.\n\nTherefore, although the direct legal authority for ADM 1100.1 (E.O. 14057) has not yet been formally rescinded, its policy foundation has been removed by E.O. 14148. Continuing to implement ADM 1100.1 aggressively would be in direct conflict with the stated intent and policy of the current administration.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\n\nTo align with the new federal policy direction, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1.  **Immediate Legal Review:** The Office of the Administrator should immediately engage the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to provide a formal legal opinion on the continued viability and enforceability of GSA Order ADM 1100.1 and the status of E.O. 14057.\n2.  **Pause New Initiatives:** Pause the launch of any new, resource-intensive projects, procurements, or regulations that are solely justified under the authority of GSA Order ADM 1100.1, pending further guidance.\n3.  **Review of Ongoing Activities:** Conduct a comprehensive review of all ongoing activities, programs, and contracts initiated under ADM 1100.1 to assess their alignment with the new policy direction outlined in E.O. 14148. Identify activities that may be considered a \"regulatory burden\" or are not otherwise justifiable under other statutory authorities.\n4.  **Prepare for Rescission or Revision:** The Office of the Administrator, in coordination with relevant Services and Staff Offices, should begin drafting plans for the potential revision or full rescission of GSA Order ADM 1100.1 to ensure an orderly transition and compliance with anticipated future executive actions.\n\n---\n\n**Final Determination: Affected**",

Its stated purpose is to create an \"implementation framework for GSA's response to the ongoing climate crisis\" with goals to \"achieve 'net zero' operational and procurement-related carbon emissions\" and adapt GSA assets to climate conditions.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions,\" is a broad, counter-policy directive aimed at reversing policies from the previous administration.

Its stated purpose is to create an \"implementation framework for GSA's response to the ongoing climate crisis\" with goals to \"achieve 'net zero' operational and procurement-related carbon emissions\" and adapt GSA assets to climate conditions.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions,\" is a broad, counter-policy directive aimed at reversing policies from the previous administration. It specifically identifies several areas for rescission, including what it terms \"climate extremism.\"\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** The executive order has a direct impact on the policy. The EO's purpose is to dismantle the very policy framework that the GSA order is designed to implement. While the EO does not name GSA Order 1100.1ADM specifically, it directly targets its subject matter. The GSA policy is a clear example of the type of federal action the EO aims to reverse. The EO signals a fundamental shift in presidential priorities, moving away from climate action and framing it as a negative economic force. This provides the authority and directive for agencies, including GSA, to halt, review, and ultimately rescind such policies.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:**\n    *   **Policy Language:** The policy's title, \"Prioritizing GSA Response to the Climate Crisis,\" and its goal to \"achieve 'net zero'\" directly align with the type of initiative the EO targets.\n    *   **Executive Order Language:** The EO explicitly states that \"Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation.\" This language creates a direct opposition to the GSA policy's prioritization of climate response, establishing the GSA policy as a target for rescission under the new administration's agenda.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** Although the Executive Order is a high-level statement of intent and does not contain specific operational instructions to rescind this particular GSA policy, its impact is still direct. As a presidential directive, it sets the governing policy for the entire executive branch. An agency-level policy that is in direct contravention of the President's stated priorities, like this one, cannot be sustained and would be immediately subject to review and reversal. Therefore, it is directly affected.",

L. No. 117-169, was enacted in August 2022. The IRA made the single largest investment in climate and energy in American history. The IRA will help the United States tackle the climate crisis, advance environmental justice, and secure our Nation s position as a world leader in domestic clean energy manufacturing. This law puts the United States on a pathway to achieving the Administration s climate goals, including a net zero operational emissions federal building portfolio by 2045, and net zero emissions procurement by 2050. Statutory Text Public Law No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818 (Aug. 16, 2022) SEC. 60502. ASSISTANCE FOR FEDERAL BUILDINGS. In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated for fiscal year 2022, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $250,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2031, to be deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund established under section 592 of title 40, United States Code, for measures necessary to convert facilities of the Administrator of General Services to high-performance green buildings (as defined in section 401 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17061)). SEC. 60503. USE OF LOW-CARBON MATERIALS. (a) APPROPRIATION. In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated for fiscal year 2022, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $2,150,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2026, to be deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund established under section 592 of title 40, United States Code, to acquire and install materials and products for use in the construction or alteration of buildings under the jurisdiction, custody, and control of the General Services Administration that have substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated with all relevant stages of production, use, and disposal as compared to estimated industry averages of similar materials or products, as determined by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. (b) DEFINITION OF GREENHOUSE GAS. In this section, the term  greenhouse gas  means the air pollutants carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. SEC. 60504. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated to the Administrator of General Services for fiscal year 2022, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $975,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2026, to be deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund established under section 592 of title 40, United States Code, for emerging and sustainable technologies, and related sustainability and environmental programs. Approach To Low Embodied Carbon Material Internal GSA Use Only - Page 4 As indicated above, IRA Section 60503 provides GSA with $2.15 billion for acquisition and installation of construction materials and products with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions as compared to estimated industry averages, as determined by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In December 2022, EPA issued an Interim Determination which provided GSA with guidance on how to identify clean building materials. Consistent with standard GSA practice and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and taking extensive industry feedback into consideration, GSA issued IRA Low Embodied Carbon (LEC) asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel materials requirements for use in acquiring compliant materials. In addition to these materials, the requirements apply to certain product assemblies if at least 80% of the assembly s total cost or total weight comprises materials that meet the LEC Requirements. In addition to acquiring and installing LEC materials, GSA needs to acquire and install high- performance green building measures and emerging and sustainable technologies. To accomplish this end, GSA needs to generate implementing solicitations and contract documents. This Desk Guide provides guidance instructing Contracting Officers and PBS Project Teams (i.e., Project Executives, Project Managers, Architect/Engineers, and Construction Managers) on incorporating IRA-funded work into required solicitations and agreements.1 This guidance supplements, and does not eliminate, other generally applicable procurement requirements (e.g., competition requirements and the Buy American and Trade Agreement Acts). Questions Questions regarding this guidance can be directed to pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov. The Office of Acquisition Management s OAM IRA Toolkit on GSA s National Acquisition Resource Center contains the most up-to-date IRA acquisition information, guidance, and tools. Questions regarding the overall IRA Program can be directed to IRA Program Questions Google Form, or directly to John.Dennis@gsa.gov. IRA Program Resources can also be found at: Inflation Reduction Act Program. Instructions for Solicitation of Construction Projects Involving IRA Funding Synopses, Solicitations, Agreements, Statements of Work and Specifications involving IRA funding must reflect a number of new elements. Specific requirements will depend on which IRA fund sources will be used: high performance green building funding, low embodied 1 Although construction solicitations and contracts are the principal focus of the Desk Guide, design and construction management requirements are also covered below. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 5 carbon construction material funding and/or emerging and sustainable technology funding.   Contracting Officers and PBS Project Teams responsible for procurements involving IRA funding must tailor procurement documents, including PBS Construction Template Solicitations and Agreements, as discussed below. Note: Contracting officers may not need all of the below language for a given project; for example, a project not involving LEC materials will not require LEC-specific evaluation factors and contract clauses, etc.   For projects utilizing indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) vehicles, the substance of the below guidance should be addressed and incorporated to the extent practicable.   For noncompetitive projects (e.g., 8(a) sole source), the substance of the below guidance should be addressed and incorporated to the extent practicable. In lieu of a LEC evaluation factor, see  Noncompetitive Proposal Evaluation Requirements  section.   Blue text indicates passages required for insertion into operative procurement documents. This coloring should be changed to black once transferred to procurement documents.   Appendix A - IRA LEC Project Checklist contains a step-by-step checklist of solicitation and contract activities for LEC construction work covered by this guidance. I. Pre-Solicitation Requirements for Projects Requiring LEC Construction Materials In publicizing a Synopsis for a Proposed LEC Project Contract Action, Contracting Officers should include prominently-displayed synopsis language as follows. (Note: This section is not applicable to projects utilizing IDIQ vehicles.) In addition to the construction opportunity reflected herein, GSA is seeking suppliers and manufacturers that are interested in supplying low embodied carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel materials for the project.

Solicitation Requirements A. Notification of Use of IRA Funds The Solicitation shall be amended by adding the below text to the cover page or similarly prominent location in the front of the Solicitation: Note: The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), Pub. L. No. 117-169, enacted in August 2022, provided GSA with significant funding for (a) measures necessary to convert facilities to high-performance green buildings, (b) acquisition and installation of construction materials and products with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions, and (c) emerging and sustainable technologies. The Contract resulting from this Solicitation will be funded in part by IRA appropriations, and it contains numerous IRA-specific requirements. Requirements include, but are not limited to, requirements regarding pricing, invoicing, submittals, materials, and construction. Offerors shall carefully review this Solicitation, the Agreement, the Statement of Work, the Specifications, and the Drawings. Offerors are responsible for accurately pricing and, if successful, fully performing all Contract requirements. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 7 If the contract will be funded in whole or in part with GSA s IRA LEC appropriation and will be procured on a competitive basis, add this sentence before the final sentence of the above passage: In addition, please note that this Solicitation contains an evaluation factor favoring certain construction materials with the lowest possible levels of embodied carbon. B. Pricing Instructions The Solicitation s Price Proposal instructions shall be amended by adding the below text to the Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Additional Proposal Requirements narrative (typically Section II.C.4): GSA is required to track spending for each of the three appropriations it received under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) -- for low-embodied carbon (LEC) materials, emerging and sustainable technologies, and high-performance green building measures -- and has established  budget activities  for each of these appropriations. A contract line item number (CLIN) for each of these budget activities has been included in the Agreement as necessary. In addition, subCLINs will be used to track spending on each of the LEC materials designated for IRA funding -- asphalt, concrete, glass, and steel. Offerors must include separate prices for IRA work under the corresponding IRA CLINs and subCLINs. Amounts for each IRA CLIN should reflect all expenses necessary to accomplish acquisition and installation of IRA work elements. A list of possible expenses follows below; this list is not exhaustive.   Expenses of acquiring and transporting products and materials required for IRA- funded work to the construction site;   Labor, general and administrative expenses, and overhead and profit reasonably attributable to installation of IRA-funded work;   Expenses for materials, tools, riggings and equipment (including safety equipment) required to install IRA-funded work;   Design, submittal and documentation expenses reasonably attributable to IRA- funded work;   Demolition and disposal expenses reasonably necessary for and attributable to IRA-funded work   Expenses necessary to return space to its condition preceding IRA-funded work;   Environmental remediation expenses required in execution of IRA-funded work; and   Phasing and commissioning expenses reasonably attributable to IRA-funded work. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 8 Note: In consultation with assigned OGC Counsel, Contracting Officers and PBS Project Teams should consider adding additional detail on specific necessary expenses associated with the project. C. Best Value Tradeoff The Solicitation s Method of Award shall be amended by adding the below text to the Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Evaluation of Offers narrative (typically Section VI.A.2): Non-Price Factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Total Evaluated Price. D. Technical Evaluation Factor for Projects Requiring LEC Construction Materials GSA s IRA LEC asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements establish numeric global warming potential (GWP) limits for each of the EPA-approved construction material categories: concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel, and glass (IRA-Eligible Materials). For each material, GWP limits have been established for the best performing 20% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 20% Limits), the best performing 40% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 40% Limits), and better than industry average (Better Than Average Limit). When procuring construction projects requiring concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel and/or glass, Contracting Officers will utilize a technical evaluation factor that favors provision of IRA- Eligible Materials with the lowest possible GWP. Instructional language and an evaluation factor template are provided below. For an example of how to establish the table and calculate the offeror s score, please refer to the IRA Solicitation Sustainability Evaluation Factor Example slides. Key Considerations:   Contracting Officers shall work with PBS Project Teams to remove any IRA-Eligible Material present in the below evaluation factor that is inapplicable to the project s anticipated material needs.   Contracting Officers shall work with PBS Project Teams to develop LEC Material Evaluation Weights for individual materials to reflect the relative approximate cost of the materials required for the project. LEC Material Evaluation Weights must add up to 100%.   Separately, the Overall Weight of the factor relative to other factors (e.g., Past Performance, Prior Experience) shall be at least 15%.   Contracting Officers shall utilize the IRA Sustainability Factor Table in solicitations, which provides Offeror Instructions, a table with all materials and built-in calculations, and an example of a completed table. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 9   Depending on market research, certain IRA-Eligible Materials may be required to meet Top 20% Limits (see Market Research and Top 20% Materials, below). Market Research and Top 20% Materials Where market research indicates, and the CIPMO confirms, that certain IRA-Eligible Materials with GWP values at or better than Top 20% Limits are or should be available for a project, Contracting Officers shall substitute the following language for the first paragraph under Technical Acceptability, below: Offerors will only meet the standard for technical acceptability under this Factor if (1) they commit to furnish IRA-Eligible [INSERT CATEGORIES OF IRA-ELIGIBLE MATERIALS THAT MUST MEET TOP 20% LIMITS] with a GWP better (lower) than such materials  Top 20% Limits; and (2) they commit to furnish all other required IRA- Eligible Materials with a GWP better (lower) than each IRA-Eligible Material s Better Than Average Limit. NOTE: Where potential offerors indicate that such IRA-Eligible Materials meeting Top 20% Limits are NOT available and, based on the Contracting Officer s and CIPMO s review, these indications appear well founded, the Contracting Officer may consider issuing a solicitation amendment relaxing the Top 20% Limit requirements for those materials, permitting submission of materials meeting Top 40% Limits or Better than Average Limits. Evaluation Factor The Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Technical Proposal narrative (typically Section II.D) shall be amended by adding the below evaluation factor (Note: For two-step Design/Build procurements, this factor should be utilized in Phase 2). Evaluation Factor # ___: Sustainability Background and Overview This project is funded in part by Section 60503 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which provides funding for purchase of construction materials with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions. GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements establish numeric global warming potential (GWP) limits for certain EPA- approved construction materials: concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel, and glass (IRA- Eligible Materials). For each material, GWP limits have been established for the best performing 20% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 20% Limits), the best performing 40% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 40% Limits), and better than industry average (Better Than Average Limit). Internal GSA Use Only - Page 10 This Evaluation Factor calls for Offeror commitments to furnishing IRA-Eligible Materials with the lowest possible GWP values. IRA Limit Commitments proposed under this evaluation factor will be incorporated into the successful offeror s resultant contract. Individual materials  GWP values may be found on individual manufacturers  environmental product declarations (EPDs) (see the sam.gov presolicitation notice for some publicly-available tools that may help identify potential suppliers). EPDs must meet the standards reflected in GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements (see Compliance Documentation criteria listed for each IRA-Eligible Material). Technical Acceptability Offerors will only meet the standard for technical acceptability under this Factor if they commit to furnish all required IRA-Eligible Materials with a GWP better (lower) than each IRA-Eligible Material s Better Than Average Limit. Scoring Offerors meeting the standard for technical acceptability, above, will receive a number of Raw Scores, one for each IRA-Eligible Material required by the Contract:   Offerors will receive a Raw Score of 90 for each IRA-Eligible Material commitment that is better (lower) than GSA s Top 20% Limits.   Offerors will receive a Raw Score of 40 for each IRA-Eligible Material commitment that is only better (lower) than GSA s Top 40% Limits.   Offerors will receive a Raw Score of 20 for each IRA-Eligible Material commitment that is only better (lower) than GSA s Better Than Average Limit. Offerors shall complete the  IRA Sustainability Factor Table  attached to this solicitation by filling out the applicable IRA Limit they commit to meet for each IRA- Eligible Material. Based upon the offeror s selection in the  IRA Limit Commitment  column, the associated Raw Score, a Preliminary Weighted Score, and the Preliminary Total Weighted Score will be automatically calculated. In addition, for each IRA-Eligible Material identified in the IRA Sustainability Factor Table, offerors shall submit EPDs listing that material s GWP. Such EPDs must meet the standards reflected in GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements (see Compliance Documentation criteria listed for each IRA-Eligible Material). Raw Score Supplement Offerors will receive a supplemental 10 points on Raw Scores for each IRA-Eligible Material where the material s submitted EPD reflects the lowest GWP value received in the competition for that material. For instance, where two offerors propose materials meeting the Top 20% Limit for glass, and Offeror A submits a glass EPD reflecting a Internal GSA Use Only - Page 11 GWP value lower than that reflected in Offeror B s glass EPD, Offeror A and B will receive raw scores of 100 and 90 for that material, respectively. During evaluations, the Government will add Raw Score Supplements, if any, to offeror s Preliminary Weighted Scores to calculate Final Weighted Scores. In the event of a tie for lowest-GWP values for a given material, those tied offerors will all receive the Raw Score Supplement for that material. Note 1: By submitting an offer, Offeror consents to unrestricted GSA use of supplier names and the GWP values associated with supplier materials. Such information may be disclosed publicly or used to inform other low embodied carbon procurement activities. Technical solutions, supplier pricing and supplier-offeror terms and conditions will not be shared. Any objection shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer by the due date for offers and shall adhere to 41 C.F.R.   105-60.601. Note 2: For each offeror that is unable to submit any of the compliant EPDs by the proposal due date, the offeror shall submit a statement for each such missing compliant EPD (a) certifying that it is unable to submit a compliant EPD by the proposal due date, and (b) promising to submit a compliant EPD within 120 days from the contract award ((a) and (b) collectively constituting an  EPD Pledge ). Failure by an offeror to submit either a compliant EPD or an EPD Pledge (as described in the immediately preceding sentence) for each IRA-Eligible Material listed in the IRA Sustainability Factor Table by the proposal due date shall result in the offeror s proposal being unacceptable. Offerors submitting an EPD Pledge in lieu of a compliant EPD for a given IRA-Eligible Material will not be eligible for a Raw Score Supplement for that material, as described above. Any awardee that submitted an EPD Pledge in lieu of a compliant EPD for a given IRA- Eligible Material will still be bound by IRA Limit Commitments made in their IRA Sustainability Factor Table. Note as well that the contract resulting from this solicitation shall have the following provision:  Within 120 days after contract award, the Contractor shall submit a compliant EPD for any IRA-Eligible Material for which the Contractor was unable to submit a compliant EPD by the proposal due date (if any). Such EPD must reflect GWP values that comply with the IRA Limit Commitments incorporated into the contract. GSA shall not issue a Notice to Proceed with construction services to the Contractor until the Contractor has submitted a compliant EPD for each IRA-Eligible Material for which the Contractor was unable to submit a compliant EPD by the proposal due date.  The Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Non-Price Factors text (typically Section VI.F.) shall be amended by adding the below evaluation factor, tailored as indicated (Weight shall be at least 15%): Evaluation Factor # ___: Sustainability Weight [INSERT (see above)]% Internal GSA Use Only - Page 12 (1) The Sustainability Factor will be scored as outlined in Section [INSERT], above. (2) GSA will verify Offeror s scoring and that IRA Limits are supported by environmental product declarations (EPDs) from proposed suppliers. (3) GSA will verify that Offeror s EPDs adhere to EPD standards reflected in GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements (see Compliance Documentation criteria listed for each IRA-Eligible Material). (4) GSA will make any scoring adjustments necessary to correct patent errors. Once GSA has verified the Offeror s scoring and, if necessary, made any corrections, the overall weighted score will be assigned an adjectival rating, as follows: [CO to tailor based on adjectival ratings utilized in the Source Selection Plan] Weighted Score Adjectival Rating 100 points Exceptional 90-99 points Very Good 20-89 points Acceptable Unacceptable Unacceptable Note 1: Any proposal that does not meet the standard for Technical Acceptability will be rated as  Unacceptable  under this factor and will be ineligible for award. Note 2: Any proposal that furnishes all required IRA-Eligible Material with a GWP better (lower) than GSA s Top 20% Limits will receive a Total Weighted Score of 90 points (Exceptional), with Raw Score Supplements potentially increasing the Total Weighted Score to 100 points. Note 3: If an EPD is not available, GSA will review the offeror s EPD Pledge. E. Noncompetitive Proposal Evaluation Requirements for Projects Requiring LEC Construction Materials GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements establish numeric global warming potential (GWP) limits for each of the EPA- approved construction material categories: concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel, and glass (IRA-Eligible Materials). For each material, GWP limits have been established for the best performing 20% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 20% Limits), the best performing Internal GSA Use Only - Page 13 40% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 40% Limits), and better than industry average (Better Than Average Limit). When procuring construction projects requiring concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel and/or glass, Contracting Officers will request that the offeror provide a proposal that favors provision of IRA-Eligible Materials with the lowest possible GWP. Depending on market research, certain IRA-Eligible Materials may be required to meet Top 20% Limits (see Market Research and Top 20% Materials, below). Instructional language and proposal requirement language are provided below. Contracting Officers shall work with PBS Project Teams to remove any IRA-Eligible Material present in the below table that is inapplicable to the project s anticipated material needs. Market Research and Top 20% Materials Where market research indicates, and the CIPMO confirms, that certain IRA-Eligible Materials with GWP values at or better than Top 20% Limits are available for a project or will be available by the anticipated contract award date, Contracting Officers shall substitute the following language for the fifth paragraph of the blue LEC Commitment Proposal language, below: For IRA-Eligible [INSERT IRA-ELIGIBLE MATERIALS THAT MUST MEET TOP 20% LIMITS], materials MUST have embodied GWP values that are less than or equal to GSA s Top 20% Limits. For all other materials, the proposal shall provide IRA-Eligible construction materials with embodied GWP values that are less than or equal to the GSA IRA Top 20% Limits reflected in GSA s IRA LEC asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements. If Top 20% materials are not available, please propose materials with embodied GWP that are less than or equal to the GSA IRA Top 40% Limit for that material. If Top 40% materials are not available for those material categories, please propose materials with embodied GWP that are less than the Better Than Average Limit for that material. NOTE: Where potential offerors indicate that IRA-Eligible Materials meeting mandatory Top 20% Limits are not available and, based on the Contracting Officer s and CIPMO s review, these indications appear well-founded, the Contracting Officer may consider amending the solicitation to relax the Top 20% Limit requirements for those materials, permitting submission of materials meeting Top 40% Limits or Better than Average Limits.

Background. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins, and has never been hacked. As a result of its scarcity and security, Bitcoin is often referred to as  digital gold . Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The United States Government currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a policy to maximize BTC s strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system. Just as it is in our country s interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United States Digital Asset Stockpile that can serve as a secure account for orderly and strategic management of the United States  other digital asset holdings. Sec. 3. Creation and Administration of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  Stra- tegic Bitcoin Reserve,  capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency (agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to sub- section (d) of this section (Government BTC). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Govern- ment BTC held by it to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. Government BTC deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law. (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  United States Digital Asset Stockpile,  capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Stockpile Assets). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Stockpile Assets held by it to the United States Digital Asset Stockpile and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine strategies for responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile in accordance with applicable law.

      "updated_flag": "Not Affected",
      "updated_summary": "The Executive Order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve operates in a completely separate policy domain from the IRA Construction Solicitation Desk Guide, with no apparent mechanisms to impact construction procurement practices or sustainability initiatives.",

      "phase1_response": "**MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD**\n\n**TO:** GSA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM)\n**FROM:** GSA Policy Analyst\n**DATE:** March 12, 2025\n**SUBJECT:** Analysis of Executive Order 14233 Impact on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Construction Solicitation Desk Guide\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of Executive Order (EO) 14233, \"Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,\" and its potential impact on the GSA's \"Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 Construction Solicitation Desk Guide.\"\n\n### 1. Summary of the Policy Text\n\nThe \"Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 Construction Solicitation Desk Guide\" is an internal GSA document providing procedural guidance to GSA personnel, particularly Contracting Officers (COs). It outlines the pre-solicitation, solicitation, and evaluation requirements for construction projects funded by the IRA. The guide focuses heavily on implementing sustainability goals, specifically the procurement and use of Low Embodied Carbon (LEC) construction materials, and details the submission and review processes, including the use of Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). Its primary purpose is to ensure GSA construction procurements comply with the environmental mandates of the IRA.\n\n### 2. Summary of the Executive Order Text\n\nExecutive Order 14233, issued on March 6, 2025, establishes a new federal policy regarding cryptocurrency. It directs the Secretary of the Treasury to create and administer a \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\" and a \"United States Digital Asset Stockpile.\" The purpose of this initiative is to strategically manage the U.S. government's holdings of Bitcoin and other digital assets, treating them as a national resource and a store of value within the global financial system. The EO is focused on high-level financial and asset management policy under the purview of the Department of the Treasury.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nThe Executive Order **does not apply to or affect** the GSA Inflation Reduction Act Construction Solicitation Desk Guide. The two documents operate in entirely separate and unrelated domains of federal policy and operations.\n\n*   **Disparate Subject Matter:** The GSA Desk Guide is concerned with the procurement of physical construction services and sustainable building materials. Its focus is on operational procurement procedures, environmental sustainability (LEC materials, GWP reduction), and project management for federal buildings. In contrast, the EO is concerned with the strategic management of digital financial assets (cryptocurrency). It addresses national financial policy, not the day-to-day procurement of goods and services.\n\n*   **No Operational Overlap:** The GSA Desk Guide governs how appropriated funds from the IRA are spent on construction contracts, which are solicited and paid for in U.S. dollars. The EO addresses the *holding* and *management* of digital assets already in the government's possession (e.g., from asset forfeiture). The EO does not authorize or suggest the use of Bitcoin or other digital assets as a medium of exchange for federal procurements, nor does it impose any reporting or disclosure requirements on federal contractors related to their own potential digital asset holdings.\n\n*   **Different Governing Authorities:** The Desk Guide is an internal GSA policy document for implementing Congressionally-mandated IRA provisions. The EO directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a new office and asset management framework. There are no directives in the EO that flow down to GSA's acquisition or construction programs.\n\nIn summary, there is no functional, financial, or regulatory connection between the policy of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve and the procedures for soliciting construction contracts that use low-carbon materials.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nAs the policy is not affected by the executive order, no actions are required to bring the Inflation Reduction Act Construction Solicitation Desk Guide into compliance. The guidance remains current and relevant to its intended purpose. It is recommended to file this analysis to document that a review was completed.\n\n---\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",
      "phase2_flag": "Not Affected",
      "phase2_justification": "1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:** The policy, titled \"IRA of 2022 Construction Solicitation Desk Guide,\" is an internal guidance document for the General Services Administration (GSA). Its domain is federal government procurement, specifically focusing on procedures for construction solicitations. Key elements mentioned in the text, such as \"Sustainability Evaluation Factor\" and \"LEC Construction Materials,\" firmly place it within the context of implementing environmental and sustainability standards from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into federal building projects.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, \"Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,\" operates in the domain",
      "phase2_response": "Final Decision: [Not Affected]\n\nFull Justification:\n1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:** The policy, titled \"IRA of 2022 Construction Solicitation Desk Guide,\" is an internal guidance document for the General Services Administration (GSA). Its domain is federal government procurement, specifically focusing on procedures for construction solicitations. Key elements mentioned in the text, such as \"Sustainability Evaluation Factor\" and \"LEC Construction Materials,\" firmly place it within the context of implementing environmental and sustainability standards from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into federal building projects.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, \"Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,\" operates in the domain of national economic policy, financial technology (FinTech), and strategic asset management. Its core purpose is to create a national policy for holding and managing cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, as a strategic reserve, treating it as a store of value akin to \"digital gold.\"\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** There is no direct or indirect impact of the executive order on the policy. The two documents operate in entirely separate and unrelated policy spheres. The policy governs the physical process of construction procurement and material standards for federal buildings. The executive order governs the nation's financial strategy concerning digital assets. The order does not contain any provisions, mandates, or language that would alter procurement processes, construction standards, funding mechanisms for the IRA, or the GSA's internal procedures.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:** The disconnect is evident from the key terminology in each document:\n    *   **Policy Text:** Key terms include \"Construction Solicitation,\" \"Sustainability Evaluation Factor,\" and \"LEC (Low Embodied Carbon) Construction Materials.\" These terms relate exclusively to physical infrastructure and environmental standards.\n    *   **EO_Text:** Key terms include \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,\" \"Digital Asset Stockpile,\" \"cryptocurrency,\" and \"global financial system.\" These terms relate exclusively to digital finance and national economic strategy.\n    The complete absence of overlapping terminology or subject matter confirms that the EO does not affect the policy.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** One could argue that a major national economic policy, such as establishing a Bitcoin reserve, might have extremely broad, downstream macroeconomic effects that could eventually influence things like federal construction budgets or the cost of materials. However, this type of abstract, second- or third-order effect is far too tenuous to be considered a relevant impact in a policy compliance analysis. The analysis must focus on direct operational, legal, or procedural connections, of which there are none in this case. The initial `phase1_flag` of \"Not Affected\" is correct.",
