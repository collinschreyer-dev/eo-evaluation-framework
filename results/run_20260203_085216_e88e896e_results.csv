The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (P.L. 117-164, the  Act ), signed by the President on December 29, 2022, only appropriated $1,470,089,000 of New Obligational Authority (NOA) in support of this request. At this time, GSA has received a 30 day auto- allotment of funds in Pegasys and all Continuing Resolution guidance is now lifted. 30 day allowances have been processed for the Basic R&A program, however allowances for the prospectus projects will not be processed until the full year apportionment is received from OMB and projects have both House and Senate approval (see FY 2023 Prospectus Updates section below for project details). Central Office will work with regions who may have any expiring bids prior to January 31st. Notification will be sent upon receipt of the full year apportionment. FY 2023 Capital Investment Program Status Update and Execution Guidance Page 1 DocuSign Envelope ID: B9DBD55F-BB2F-499B-89B5-A6FB6F03BEE1 FY 2023 Capital Investment Program Update Construction and Acquisition Program Appropriations The $807,809,000 appropriated for the New Construction and Acquisition (BA51) Program was $399,786,000 above the requested amount. Funding under this program was provided for the U.S. Courthouses in Hartford, CT, Fort Lauderdale, FL, Chattanooga, TN, the DHS Consolidation at St. Elizabeths, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Lease Purchase Option, the Southeast Federal Center Remediation, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters Consolidation. Regarding the U.S. Courthouses: - Since Hartford and Chattanooga were partially funded in FY 2021 and FY 2022, prospectuses in support of these projects were transmitted to GSA s Authorizing Committees, and we have received both House and Senate approvals. - Considering Fort Lauderdale previously received FY 2018 appropriations, both House and Senate FY 2018 prospectus approvals, and original scope has not changed, GSA may proceed awarding the additional FY 2023 funding to address cost escalation due to time and market conditions associated with the FY 2018 prospectus scope. FY 2023 Capital Investment Program Status Update and Execution Guidance Page 2 DocuSign Envelope ID: B9DBD55F-BB2F-499B-89B5-A6FB6F03BEE1 NOTE: In FY 2023, Congress increased our internal BA51 escalation prospectus authority from 10% up to 20%. Increasing our escalation authority affords GSA more internal flexibility to cover cost increases for these BA51 projects without first obtaining external OMB and Congressional approval. This 20% increased threshold applies only to the new construction and remediation project funding listed in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. All previous New Construction funding is still subject to the previous 10% internal escalation threshold. Major Repairs and Alterations Program Appropriations The $662,280,000 appropriated for Major Repairs and Alterations (Major R&A) was $1,089,590,000 less than the requested amount of $1,751,870,000. Unlike previous years, the Act provided specific line item appropriations for each of our Major R&A Programs. - The Basic Repairs and Alterations (BA54) program was appropriated at our full requested amount of $398,797,000. - The $244,783,000 appropriated for Major R&A (BA55) projects was $943,290,000 less than the requested amount of $1,188,073,000. - The $18,700,000 appropriated for Special Emphasis (BA55) programs was $146,300,000 less than the requested amount of $165,000,000. FY 2023 Capital Investment Program Status Update and Execution Guidance Page 3 DocuSign Envelope ID: B9DBD55F-BB2F-499B-89B5-A6FB6F03BEE1 NOTE: In FY 2023, Congress increased our internal BA55 escalation prospectus authority from 10% up to 20%. Increasing our escalation authority affords GSA more internal flexibility to cover cost increases for BA55 projects without first obtaining external OMB and Congressional approval. Furthermore, since the Act s provision specifically states ""funds made available in this or any previous Act...."", the 20% increased threshold also applies to previous years BA55 prospectus projects and funding. FY 2023 Prospectus Updates Projects are unable to move forward unless both House and Senate authorizing committee prospectus approval is received. Updates on the FY 2023 Capital Investment Program prospectus approvals can be found at the FY 2023 Capital Investment Program At a Glance1, and updates and copies of the prospectuses and Committee Resolutions can be found on the D2D Prospectus Pipeline and the Capital Investment and Leasing Program Prospectus Library on gsa.gov. - Green signifies full prospectus approval received. Regions MAY proceed with full procurement activities and make awards. - Yellow signifies outstanding approval is needed. Regions MAY proceed with limited pre-procurement activities (activities prior to the ""public facing"" activities such as the advertisement (RFQ) for all FY23 projects (such as developing the actual Scope of Work that will be used in the Request For Qualifications (RFQ) and then the Request for Proposal (RFP); developing Source Selection plan and scoring criteria; assembling the source selection team, reaching a decision on who to select finalizing the CapPMP, Acquisition Plan, etc....). Regions MAY NOT make an award until notified from Central Office that both House and Senate authorizing committee prospectus approval have been received. 1 Snapshot as of 1/12/2023 FY 2023 Capital Investment Program Status Update and Execution Guidance Page 4 DocuSign Envelope ID: B9DBD55F-BB2F-499B-89B5-A6FB6F03BEE1 Hurricane Ian Supplemental Appropriation Title V of the FY 2023 Act provided an additional amount to be deposited in the  Federal Buildings Fund , $36,788,390, to remain available until expended, for necessary expenses related to the consequences of Hurricane Ian, for repair and alteration of buildings under the jurisdiction, custody and control of the Administrator of General Services, and real property management and related activities not otherwise provided for: Provided, That the amount provided under this heading in this Act may be used to reimburse the Fund for obligations incurred for this purpose prior to the date of the enactment of this Act.

Purpose. Federal regulations should not predetermine economic winners and losers. Yet some regulations operate to exclude new market entrants. Regulations that reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innova- tion as well as the benefits they create for American consumers should be eliminated. This order commences the process for eliminating anti-com- petitive regulations to revitalize the American economy. Sec. 2. Definitions. (a)  Agency  has the meaning given to it in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code, except that it does not include the Executive Office of the President or any components thereof. (b)  Agency head  means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director, unless otherwise specified in this order. Sec. 3. Rescinding Anti-Competitive Regulations. (a) Agency heads shall, in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (Chair- man) and the Attorney General, complete a review of all regulations subject to their rulemaking authority and identify those that: (i) create, or facilitate the creation of, de facto or de jure monopolies; (ii) create unnecessary barriers to entry for new market participants; (iii) limit competition between competing entities or have the effect of limiting competition between competing entities; (iv) create or facilitate licensure or accreditation requirements that unduly limit competition; (v) unnecessarily burden the agency s procurement processes, thereby lim- iting companies  ability to compete for procurements; or (vi) otherwise impose anti-competitive restraints or distortions on the oper- ation of the free market. (b) Within 70 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall each provide to the Chairman and the Attorney General a list of regulations identified by the categories specified in subsection (a) of this section. Agency heads shall also include a recommendation as to whether each of the listed regulations warrants rescission or modification in light of its anti-competitive effects. For recommended modifications, agency heads shall briefly specify what modification is appropriate. For regulations that are anti-competitive by design, agency heads shall provide a justification for their anti-competitive effects if the agency head is not proposing rescission or modification. (c) In conducting the review required by subsection (a) of this section, agency heads shall prioritize review of those rules that satisfy the definition of  significant regulatory action  in Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended. (d) Within 10 days of the date of this order, the Chairman shall issue a request for information (RFI) that seeks public input on the identification of regulations that fall within the categories specified in subsection (a) of this section, as well as comments explaining the proposed classifications.

(e) Within 90 days of receipt of the agency lists specified in subsection (b) of this section, the Chairman, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the relevant agency heads, shall provide to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) a consolidated list of regulations that warrant rescission or modification in light of their anti-competitive effects, along with rec- ommended modifications. The Chairman may include on the consolidated list regulations not originally included on an agency list if such regulations fall within at least one of the categories outlined in subsections (a)(i)  (vi) of this section. (f) Upon receipt of the consolidated list described in subsection (e) of this section, the OMB Director, through the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, shall consult with the Chairman, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the relevant agency heads to decide whether to incorporate the proposed rescissions or modifications into the Unified Regulatory Agenda developed pursuant to Executive Order 14219 of February 19, 2025 (Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President s  Department of Government Efficiency  Deregulatory Initiative).

1. Policy Text Summary:
The GSA memorandum dated January 13, 2023, provides guidance on the Fiscal Year 2023 Capital Investment Program. Key points include:
- Total Capital Budget of $2,159,893,000
- Increased escalation authority from 10% to 20% for New Construction and Acquisition (BA51) and Major Repairs and Alterations (BA55) projects
- Detailed funding allocations for various construction and renovation projects
- Guidance on project procurement and approval processes

2. Executive Order Summary:
Executive Order 14267 (April 9, 2025) aims to:
- Reduce anti-competitive regulatory barriers
- Require agencies to review and identify regulations that:
  a) Create monopolies
  b) Limit market competition
  c) Create unnecessary entry barriers
  d) Impose anti-competitive restraints
- Mandate a comprehensive review of existing regulations
- Establish a process for potential rescission or modification of anti-competitive regulations

3. Applicability of Executive Order:
The executive order DOES apply to this GSA policy for the following reasons:
- The policy involves procurement and investment processes
- The escalation authority and project approval mechanisms could potentially be viewed as creating regulatory barriers
- The order specifically targets regulations that might limit competition in government processes

4. Recommended Next Steps for Compliance:
a) Conduct a thorough review of the Capital Investment Program guidelines
b) Assess how current escalation authorities and project approval processes might create market entry barriers
c) Prepare documentation justifying the current regulatory approach
d) Be prepared to provide detailed explanations of how current processes:
   - Do not unduly limit market competition
   - Ensure fair and open procurement
   - Provide equal opportunities for different market participants
e) Collaborate with the Federal Trade Commission and Attorney General's office to validate the current regulatory approach
f) Be ready to modify guidelines if anti-competitive elements are identified

Recommendation: While the current policy appears to provide flexibility (20% escalation authority), a proactive review should be conducted to ensure full compliance with the executive order's intent of promoting market competition.",Not affected,Affected,The executive order's focus on reducing regulatory barriers directly impacts the GSA's Capital Investment Program by mandating a review of potential anti-competitive elements in procurement and project approval processes. The policy's escalation authorities and approval mechanisms will need careful examination to ensure they do not inadvertently limit market competition.,Affected,"## Policy Analysis Summary

### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Document
The GSA memorandum from January 13, 2023, provides guidance on the FY 2023 Capital Investment Program execution following Congressional appropriations. The document outlines that GSA requested $2.16 billion but received only $1.47 billion in appropriations. It provides operational guidance for regional directors on budget execution, project approvals, and fund allocation processes. The memo specifically addresses construction and acquisition programs, prospectus project approvals, and procedural requirements for project implementation.

### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order
Executive Order 14267, dated April 9, 2025, titled ""Reducing Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers,"" directs federal agencies to identify and eliminate regulations that reduce competition, create barriers to market entry, or facilitate monopolistic practices. The order requires agency heads to review all regulations under their authority and identify those that: create monopolies, impose unnecessary barriers to entry, limit competition, create burdensome licensing requirements, unnecessarily burden procurement processes, or impose anti-competitive restraints on free market operations.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability
This executive order **does apply** to the GSA policy document, but with important distinctions:

**Areas of Potential Impact:**
- **Procurement Processes**: The executive order specifically targets regulations that ""unnecessarily burden the agency's procurement processes, thereby limiting companies' ability to compete for procurements"" (Section 3(a)(v)). The GSA memorandum establishes procedural requirements for project approvals, fund allocation, and bid processes that could potentially limit competition.
- **Regulatory Authority**: As a federal agency, GSA falls under the executive order's scope and must review its regulations and procedures.

**Limited Direct Impact:**
- The memorandum is primarily an **internal operational guidance document** rather than a public-facing regulation that directly affects market competition.
- The funding limitations and approval processes described are largely driven by Congressional appropriations and statutory requirements rather than discretionary GSA regulations.
- The procedural requirements (such as House and Senate approvals for prospectus projects) are mandated by law rather than agency choice.

**Key Consideration:**
While this specific memorandum may not directly create anti-competitive barriers, the underlying GSA regulations and procedures that govern capital investment programs, procurement processes, and contractor selection criteria would need review under this executive order.

### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance

1. **Comprehensive Regulatory Review**: GSA should conduct a thorough review of all regulations governing capital investment programs, construction procurement, and contractor selection processes to identify potential anti-competitive elements.

2. **Stakeholder Consultation**: Engage with the Federal Trade Commission Chairman and Attorney General as required by the executive order to assess current procurement and project approval processes.

3. **Process Streamlining**: Evaluate whether current procedural requirements for project approvals, bid submissions, and contractor qualifications create unnecessary barriers to market entry.

4. **Documentation Review**: Examine whether requirements for prospectus project approvals, funding allocations, and regional coordination create competitive disadvantages for certain market participants.

5. **Timeline Compliance**: Establish a timeline for completing the regulatory review and implementing any necessary changes to ensure compliance with the executive order's mandates.

6. **Monitoring Implementation**: Develop mechanisms to ensure future policy documents and operational guidance align with anti-competitive regulatory reduction goals.

**Final Determination: [Affected]**",Not Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal budget execution and internal GSA financial management procedures for capital investment programs.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Elimination of anti-competitive regulatory barriers that prevent market entry and reduce competition.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact because:
   - The GSA memorandum is an internal budget execution document, not a regulation
   - It does not establish market barriers or competitive restrictions
   - It deals with how GSA manages its appropriated funds, not how it regulates external parties
   - The document's focus on ""30-day auto-allotment"" and ""Continuing Resolution guidance"" are purely internal administrative matters

4. **Key Language Supporting Determination**: 
   - The policy text discusse","**Step 1: Policy Domain Analysis**
The policy is a GSA memorandum regarding FY 2023 Capital Investment Program execution, specifically dealing with budget appropriations, funding authority, and internal administrative procedures for capital projects. The domain is **federal budget execution and internal agency financial management**.

**Step 2: Executive Order Domain Analysis**
Executive Order 14267 focuses on ""Reducing Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers"" and aims to eliminate regulations that exclude market entrants, reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innovation. The domain is **regulatory reform to promote market competition**.

**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**
These domains operate in fundamentally different spheres:
- The policy deals with internal budget execution and administrative procedures
- The executive order addresses external regulatory barriers affecting market competition

The GSA memorandum is purely an internal administrative document about fund allocation and does not create or maintain regulatory barriers that would affect market entry or competition.

**Step 4: Independent Assessment Context**
While the Phase 1 flag indicates ""Affected,"" my independent analysis suggests this may be an over-inclusive classification. The policy contains no regulatory provisions that would fall under the executive order's scope.

**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal budget execution and internal GSA financial management procedures for capital investment programs.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Elimination of anti-competitive regulatory barriers that prevent market entry and reduce competition.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact because:
   - The GSA memorandum is an internal budget execution document, not a regulation
   - It does not establish market barriers or competitive restrictions
   - It deals with how GSA manages its appropriated funds, not how it regulates external parties
   - The document's focus on ""30-day auto-allotment"" and ""Continuing Resolution guidance"" are purely internal administrative matters

4. **Key Language Supporting Determination**: 
   - The policy text discusses ""New Obligational Authority (NOA)"" and ""30 day allowances"" - internal budget terms
   - EO 14267 targets ""regulations that exclude new market entrants"" and ""reduce competition"" - external market regulation
   - No overlap exists between internal budget procedures and external competitive regulations

5. **Nuances Considered**: While GSA's capital investments might eventually involve procurement that could theoretically relate to competition, this particular memorandum addresses only the internal budget execution process, not procurement regulations or competitive procedures. The connection is too attenuated to establish relevance under the executive order's specific focus on anti-competitive regulatory barriers."

In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated for fiscal year 2022, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $250,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2031, to be deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund established under section 592 of title 40, United States Code, for measures necessary to convert facilities of the Administrator of General Services to high-performance green buildings (as defined in section 401 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17061)). SEC. 60503. USE OF LOW-CARBON MATERIALS. (a) APPROPRIATION. In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated for fiscal year 2022, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $2,150,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2026, to be deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund established under section 592 of title 40, United States Code, to acquire and install materials and products for use in the construction or alteration of buildings under the jurisdiction, custody, and control of the General Services Administration that have substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated with all relevant stages of production, use, and disposal as compared to estimated industry averages of similar materials or products, as determined by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. (b) DEFINITION OF GREENHOUSE GAS. In this section, the term  greenhouse gas  means the air pollutants carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. SEC. 60504. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated to the Administrator of General Services for fiscal year 2022, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $975,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2026, to be deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund established under section 592 of title 40, United States Code, for emerging and sustainable technologies, and related sustainability and environmental programs. Approach To Low Embodied Carbon Material Internal GSA Use Only - Page 4 As indicated above, IRA Section 60503 provides GSA with $2.15 billion for acquisition and installation of construction materials and products with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions as compared to estimated industry averages, as determined by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In December 2022, EPA issued an Interim Determination which provided GSA with guidance on how to identify clean building materials. Consistent with standard GSA practice and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and taking extensive industry feedback into consideration, GSA issued IRA Low Embodied Carbon (LEC) asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel materials requirements for use in acquiring compliant materials. In addition to these materials, the requirements apply to certain product assemblies if at least 80% of the assembly s total cost or total weight comprises materials that meet the LEC Requirements. In addition to acquiring and installing LEC materials, GSA needs to acquire and install high- performance green building measures and emerging and sustainable technologies. To accomplish this end, GSA needs to generate implementing solicitations and contract documents. This Desk Guide provides guidance instructing Contracting Officers and PBS Project Teams (i.e., Project Executives, Project Managers, Architect/Engineers, and Construction Managers) on incorporating IRA-funded work into required solicitations and agreements.1 This guidance supplements, and does not eliminate, other generally applicable procurement requirements (e.g., competition requirements and the Buy American and Trade Agreement Acts). Questions Questions regarding this guidance can be directed to pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov. The Office of Acquisition Management s OAM IRA Toolkit on GSA s National Acquisition Resource Center contains the most up-to-date IRA acquisition information, guidance, and tools. Questions regarding the overall IRA Program can be directed to IRA Program Questions Google Form, or directly to John.Dennis@gsa.gov. IRA Program Resources can also be found at: Inflation Reduction Act Program. Instructions for Solicitation of Construction Projects Involving IRA Funding Synopses, Solicitations, Agreements, Statements of Work and Specifications involving IRA funding must reflect a number of new elements. Specific requirements will depend on which IRA fund sources will be used: high performance green building funding, low embodied 1 Although construction solicitations and contracts are the principal focus of the Desk Guide, design and construction management requirements are also covered below. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 5 carbon construction material funding and/or emerging and sustainable technology funding.   Contracting Officers and PBS Project Teams responsible for procurements involving IRA funding must tailor procurement documents, including PBS Construction Template Solicitations and Agreements, as discussed below. Note: Contracting officers may not need all of the below language for a given project; for example, a project not involving LEC materials will not require LEC-specific evaluation factors and contract clauses, etc.   For projects utilizing indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) vehicles, the substance of the below guidance should be addressed and incorporated to the extent practicable.   For noncompetitive projects (e.g., 8(a) sole source), the substance of the below guidance should be addressed and incorporated to the extent practicable. In lieu of a LEC evaluation factor, see  Noncompetitive Proposal Evaluation Requirements  section.   Blue text indicates passages required for insertion into operative procurement documents. This coloring should be changed to black once transferred to procurement documents.   Appendix A - IRA LEC Project Checklist contains a step-by-step checklist of solicitation and contract activities for LEC construction work covered by this guidance. I. Pre-Solicitation Requirements for Projects Requiring LEC Construction Materials In publicizing a Synopsis for a Proposed LEC Project Contract Action, Contracting Officers should include prominently-displayed synopsis language as follows. (Note: This section is not applicable to projects utilizing IDIQ vehicles.) In addition to the construction opportunity reflected herein, GSA is seeking suppliers and manufacturers that are interested in supplying low embodied carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel materials for the project.

Solicitation Requirements A. Notification of Use of IRA Funds The Solicitation shall be amended by adding the below text to the cover page or similarly prominent location in the front of the Solicitation: Note: The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), Pub. L. No. 117-169, enacted in August 2022, provided GSA with significant funding for (a) measures necessary to convert facilities to high-performance green buildings, (b) acquisition and installation of construction materials and products with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions, and (c) emerging and sustainable technologies. The Contract resulting from this Solicitation will be funded in part by IRA appropriations, and it contains numerous IRA-specific requirements. Requirements include, but are not limited to, requirements regarding pricing, invoicing, submittals, materials, and construction. Offerors shall carefully review this Solicitation, the Agreement, the Statement of Work, the Specifications, and the Drawings. Offerors are responsible for accurately pricing and, if successful, fully performing all Contract requirements. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 7 If the contract will be funded in whole or in part with GSA s IRA LEC appropriation and will be procured on a competitive basis, add this sentence before the final sentence of the above passage: In addition, please note that this Solicitation contains an evaluation factor favoring certain construction materials with the lowest possible levels of embodied carbon. B. Pricing Instructions The Solicitation s Price Proposal instructions shall be amended by adding the below text to the Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Additional Proposal Requirements narrative (typically Section II.C.4): GSA is required to track spending for each of the three appropriations it received under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) -- for low-embodied carbon (LEC) materials, emerging and sustainable technologies, and high-performance green building measures -- and has established  budget activities  for each of these appropriations. A contract line item number (CLIN) for each of these budget activities has been included in the Agreement as necessary. In addition, subCLINs will be used to track spending on each of the LEC materials designated for IRA funding -- asphalt, concrete, glass, and steel. Offerors must include separate prices for IRA work under the corresponding IRA CLINs and subCLINs. Amounts for each IRA CLIN should reflect all expenses necessary to accomplish acquisition and installation of IRA work elements. A list of possible expenses follows below; this list is not exhaustive.   Expenses of acquiring and transporting products and materials required for IRA- funded work to the construction site;   Labor, general and administrative expenses, and overhead and profit reasonably attributable to installation of IRA-funded work;   Expenses for materials, tools, riggings and equipment (including safety equipment) required to install IRA-funded work;   Design, submittal and documentation expenses reasonably attributable to IRA- funded work;   Demolition and disposal expenses reasonably necessary for and attributable to IRA-funded work   Expenses necessary to return space to its condition preceding IRA-funded work;   Environmental remediation expenses required in execution of IRA-funded work; and   Phasing and commissioning expenses reasonably attributable to IRA-funded work. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 8 Note: In consultation with assigned OGC Counsel, Contracting Officers and PBS Project Teams should consider adding additional detail on specific necessary expenses associated with the project. C. Best Value Tradeoff The Solicitation s Method of Award shall be amended by adding the below text to the Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Evaluation of Offers narrative (typically Section VI.A.2): Non-Price Factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Total Evaluated Price. D. Technical Evaluation Factor for Projects Requiring LEC Construction Materials GSA s IRA LEC asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements establish numeric global warming potential (GWP) limits for each of the EPA-approved construction material categories: concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel, and glass (IRA-Eligible Materials). For each material, GWP limits have been established for the best performing 20% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 20% Limits), the best performing 40% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 40% Limits), and better than industry average (Better Than Average Limit). When procuring construction projects requiring concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel and/or glass, Contracting Officers will utilize a technical evaluation factor that favors provision of IRA- Eligible Materials with the lowest possible GWP. Instructional language and an evaluation factor template are provided below. For an example of how to establish the table and calculate the offeror s score, please refer to the IRA Solicitation Sustainability Evaluation Factor Example slides. Key Considerations:   Contracting Officers shall work with PBS Project Teams to remove any IRA-Eligible Material present in the below evaluation factor that is inapplicable to the project s anticipated material needs.   Contracting Officers shall work with PBS Project Teams to develop LEC Material Evaluation Weights for individual materials to reflect the relative approximate cost of the materials required for the project. LEC Material Evaluation Weights must add up to 100%.   Separately, the Overall Weight of the factor relative to other factors (e.g., Past Performance, Prior Experience) shall be at least 15%.   Contracting Officers shall utilize the IRA Sustainability Factor Table in solicitations, which provides Offeror Instructions, a table with all materials and built-in calculations, and an example of a completed table. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 9   Depending on market research, certain IRA-Eligible Materials may be required to meet Top 20% Limits (see Market Research and Top 20% Materials, below). Market Research and Top 20% Materials Where market research indicates, and the CIPMO confirms, that certain IRA-Eligible Materials with GWP values at or better than Top 20% Limits are or should be available for a project, Contracting Officers shall substitute the following language for the first paragraph under Technical Acceptability, below: Offerors will only meet the standard for technical acceptability under this Factor if (1) they commit to furnish IRA-Eligible [INSERT CATEGORIES OF IRA-ELIGIBLE MATERIALS THAT MUST MEET TOP 20% LIMITS] with a GWP better (lower) than such materials  Top 20% Limits; and (2) they commit to furnish all other required IRA- Eligible Materials with a GWP better (lower) than each IRA-Eligible Material s Better Than Average Limit. NOTE: Where potential offerors indicate that such IRA-Eligible Materials meeting Top 20% Limits are NOT available and, based on the Contracting Officer s and CIPMO s review, these indications appear well founded, the Contracting Officer may consider issuing a solicitation amendment relaxing the Top 20% Limit requirements for those materials, permitting submission of materials meeting Top 40% Limits or Better than Average Limits. Evaluation Factor The Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Technical Proposal narrative (typically Section II.D) shall be amended by adding the below evaluation factor (Note: For two-step Design/Build procurements, this factor should be utilized in Phase 2). Evaluation Factor # ___: Sustainability Background and Overview This project is funded in part by Section 60503 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which provides funding for purchase of construction materials with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions. GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements establish numeric global warming potential (GWP) limits for certain EPA- approved construction materials: concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel, and glass (IRA- Eligible Materials). For each material, GWP limits have been established for the best performing 20% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 20% Limits), the best performing 40% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 40% Limits), and better than industry average (Better Than Average Limit). Internal GSA Use Only - Page 10 This Evaluation Factor calls for Offeror commitments to furnishing IRA-Eligible Materials with the lowest possible GWP values. IRA Limit Commitments proposed under this evaluation factor will be incorporated into the successful offeror s resultant contract. Individual materials  GWP values may be found on individual manufacturers  environmental product declarations (EPDs) (see the sam.gov presolicitation notice for some publicly-available tools that may help identify potential suppliers). EPDs must meet the standards reflected in GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements (see Compliance Documentation criteria listed for each IRA-Eligible Material). Technical Acceptability Offerors will only meet the standard for technical acceptability under this Factor if they commit to furnish all required IRA-Eligible Materials with a GWP better (lower) than each IRA-Eligible Material s Better Than Average Limit. Scoring Offerors meeting the standard for technical acceptability, above, will receive a number of Raw Scores, one for each IRA-Eligible Material required by the Contract:   Offerors will receive a Raw Score of 90 for each IRA-Eligible Material commitment that is better (lower) than GSA s Top 20% Limits.   Offerors will receive a Raw Score of 40 for each IRA-Eligible Material commitment that is only better (lower) than GSA s Top 40% Limits.   Offerors will receive a Raw Score of 20 for each IRA-Eligible Material commitment that is only better (lower) than GSA s Better Than Average Limit. Offerors shall complete the  IRA Sustainability Factor Table  attached to this solicitation by filling out the applicable IRA Limit they commit to meet for each IRA- Eligible Material. Based upon the offeror s selection in the  IRA Limit Commitment  column, the associated Raw Score, a Preliminary Weighted Score, and the Preliminary Total Weighted Score will be automatically calculated. In addition, for each IRA-Eligible Material identified in the IRA Sustainability Factor Table, offerors shall submit EPDs listing that material s GWP. Such EPDs must meet the standards reflected in GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements (see Compliance Documentation criteria listed for each IRA-Eligible Material). Raw Score Supplement Offerors will receive a supplemental 10 points on Raw Scores for each IRA-Eligible Material where the material s submitted EPD reflects the lowest GWP value received in the competition for that material. For instance, where two offerors propose materials meeting the Top 20% Limit for glass, and Offeror A submits a glass EPD reflecting a Internal GSA Use Only - Page 11 GWP value lower than that reflected in Offeror B s glass EPD, Offeror A and B will receive raw scores of 100 and 90 for that material, respectively. During evaluations, the Government will add Raw Score Supplements, if any, to offeror s Preliminary Weighted Scores to calculate Final Weighted Scores. In the event of a tie for lowest-GWP values for a given material, those tied offerors will all receive the Raw Score Supplement for that material. Note 1: By submitting an offer, Offeror consents to unrestricted GSA use of supplier names and the GWP values associated with supplier materials. Such information may be disclosed publicly or used to inform other low embodied carbon procurement activities. Technical solutions, supplier pricing and supplier-offeror terms and conditions will not be shared. Any objection shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer by the due date for offers and shall adhere to 41 C.F.R.   105-60.601. Note 2: For each offeror that is unable to submit any of the compliant EPDs by the proposal due date, the offeror shall submit a statement for each such missing compliant EPD (a) certifying that it is unable to submit a compliant EPD by the proposal due date, and (b) promising to submit a compliant EPD within 120 days from the contract award ((a) and (b) collectively constituting an  EPD Pledge ). Failure by an offeror to submit either a compliant EPD or an EPD Pledge (as described in the immediately preceding sentence) for each IRA-Eligible Material listed in the IRA Sustainability Factor Table by the proposal due date shall result in the offeror s proposal being unacceptable. Offerors submitting an EPD Pledge in lieu of a compliant EPD for a given IRA-Eligible Material will not be eligible for a Raw Score Supplement for that material, as described above. Any awardee that submitted an EPD Pledge in lieu of a compliant EPD for a given IRA- Eligible Material will still be bound by IRA Limit Commitments made in their IRA Sustainability Factor Table. Note as well that the contract resulting from this solicitation shall have the following provision:  Within 120 days after contract award, the Contractor shall submit a compliant EPD for any IRA-Eligible Material for which the Contractor was unable to submit a compliant EPD by the proposal due date (if any). Such EPD must reflect GWP values that comply with the IRA Limit Commitments incorporated into the contract. GSA shall not issue a Notice to Proceed with construction services to the Contractor until the Contractor has submitted a compliant EPD for each IRA-Eligible Material for which the Contractor was unable to submit a compliant EPD by the proposal due date.  The Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Non-Price Factors text (typically Section VI.F.) shall be amended by adding the below evaluation factor, tailored as indicated (Weight shall be at least 15%): Evaluation Factor # ___: Sustainability Weight [INSERT (see above)]% Internal GSA Use Only - Page 12 (1) The Sustainability Factor will be scored as outlined in Section [INSERT], above. (2) GSA will verify Offeror s scoring and that IRA Limits are supported by environmental product declarations (EPDs) from proposed suppliers. (3) GSA will verify that Offeror s EPDs adhere to EPD standards reflected in GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements (see Compliance Documentation criteria listed for each IRA-Eligible Material). (4) GSA will make any scoring adjustments necessary to correct patent errors. Once GSA has verified the Offeror s scoring and, if necessary, made any corrections, the overall weighted score will be assigned an adjectival rating, as follows: [CO to tailor based on adjectival ratings utilized in the Source Selection Plan] Weighted Score Adjectival Rating 100 points Exceptional 90-99 points Very Good 20-89 points Acceptable Unacceptable Unacceptable Note 1: Any proposal that does not meet the standard for Technical Acceptability will be rated as  Unacceptable  under this factor and will be ineligible for award. Note 2: Any proposal that furnishes all required IRA-Eligible Material with a GWP better (lower) than GSA s Top 20% Limits will receive a Total Weighted Score of 90 points (Exceptional), with Raw Score Supplements potentially increasing the Total Weighted Score to 100 points. Note 3: If an EPD is not available, GSA will review the offeror s EPD Pledge. E. Noncompetitive Proposal Evaluation Requirements for Projects Requiring LEC Construction Materials GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements establish numeric global warming potential (GWP) limits for each of the EPA- approved construction material categories: concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel, and glass (IRA-Eligible Materials). For each material, GWP limits have been established for the best performing 20% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 20% Limits), the best performing Internal GSA Use Only - Page 13 40% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 40% Limits), and better than industry average (Better Than Average Limit). When procuring construction projects requiring concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel and/or glass, Contracting Officers will request that the offeror provide a proposal that favors provision of IRA-Eligible Materials with the lowest possible GWP. Depending on market research, certain IRA-Eligible Materials may be required to meet Top 20% Limits (see Market Research and Top 20% Materials, below). Instructional language and proposal requirement language are provided below. Contracting Officers shall work with PBS Project Teams to remove any IRA-Eligible Material present in the below table that is inapplicable to the project s anticipated material needs. Market Research and Top 20% Materials Where market research indicates, and the CIPMO confirms, that certain IRA-Eligible Materials with GWP values at or better than Top 20% Limits are available for a project or will be available by the anticipated contract award date, Contracting Officers shall substitute the following language for the fifth paragraph of the blue LEC Commitment Proposal language, below: For IRA-Eligible [INSERT IRA-ELIGIBLE MATERIALS THAT MUST MEET TOP 20% LIMITS], materials MUST have embodied GWP values that are less than or equal to GSA s Top 20% Limits. For all other materials, the proposal shall provide IRA-Eligible construction materials with embodied GWP values that are less than or equal to the GSA IRA Top 20% Limits reflected in GSA s IRA LEC asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements. If Top 20% materials are not available, please propose materials with embodied GWP that are less than or equal to the GSA IRA Top 40% Limit for that material. If Top 40% materials are not available for those material categories, please propose materials with embodied GWP that are less than the Better Than Average Limit for that material. NOTE: Where potential offerors indicate that IRA-Eligible Materials meeting mandatory Top 20% Limits are not available and, based on the Contracting Officer s and CIPMO s review, these indications appear well-founded, the Contracting Officer may consider amending the solicitation to relax the Top 20% Limit requirements for those materials, permitting submission of materials meeting Top 40% Limits or Better than Average Limits. The Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201 for Sole Source Procurements) Additional Proposal Requirements (typically Section II.C(2)) shall be amended by adding the below: LEC Commitment Proposal Internal GSA Use Only - Page 14 This project is funded in part by Section 60503 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which provides funding for purchase of construction materials with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions.

1. Policy Summary:
The document is the ""Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 Construction Solicitation Desk Guide"" detailing GSA's implementation guidelines for construction projects funded under the Inflation Reduction Act. It provides comprehensive instructions for solicitation, contract requirements, and sustainability efforts across three key areas: high-performance green buildings, low embodied carbon materials, and emerging sustainable technologies.

2. Executive Order Summary:
This is a presidential proclamation regarding the flying of the United States flag at full-staff on Inauguration Day. The order specifically directs flag protocol for the day of inauguration and subsequent actions related to half-staffing in memory of former President Jimmy Carter.

3. Applicability Analysis:
The executive order does NOT substantively impact the Inflation Reduction Act Construction Solicitation Desk Guide. The proclamation is purely a flag protocol document and contains no provisions that would alter GSA's procurement, construction, or sustainability policies.

The executive order:
- Relates to flag display protocols
- Concerns a specific day (Inauguration Day)
- Has no bearing on construction, procurement, or sustainability practices

4. Compliance Next Steps:
No compliance actions are required. The Inflation Reduction Act Construction Solicitation Desk Guide can continue to be implemented as originally drafted.

Recommendation: File this executive order in standard administrative documentation without requiring any policy modifications.",Not affected,Not Affected,"The executive order regarding flag display on Inauguration Day has no material relationship to GSA's Inflation Reduction Act Construction Solicitation guidelines, and therefore does not affect the existing policy framework.",Not Affected,"## Policy Analysis: Executive Order Impact Assessment

### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text

The policy document is the GSA's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 Construction Solicitation Desk Guide, last updated October 1, 2024. This internal guidance document provides instructions for GSA personnel on soliciting construction projects that involve IRA funding and require Low Embodied Carbon (LEC) construction materials. The guide covers pre-solicitation requirements, solicitation procedures, evaluation factors including sustainability criteria, specification requirements, and review processes. Key elements include requirements for Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), Global Warming Potential (GWP) material designations, and various forms and submission requirements for IRA-eligible construction projects.

### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text

Presidential Proclamation 10885, issued January 20, 2025, establishes a directive regarding flag protocols for Inauguration Day. The order mandates that the U.S. flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day (and all future Inauguration Days) at all federal facilities including the White House, public buildings, military installations, naval vessels, embassies, and consular offices. The order also specifies that after Inauguration Day concludes, flags should return to half-staff in accordance with a previous proclamation honoring former President Carter until the 30-day mourning period expires.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability

This executive order **does not apply** to the GSA Construction Solicitation Desk Guide policy. The executive order addresses ceremonial flag protocols for federal facilities on a specific day (Inauguration Day), while the policy document governs construction procurement procedures under the Inflation Reduction Act.

**Key distinctions:**
- **Subject Matter**: The executive order deals with flag display protocols; the policy covers construction solicitation procedures
- **Scope**: The executive order is a one-time ceremonial directive; the policy is ongoing operational guidance
- **Implementation**: The executive order requires no changes to construction procurement processes or environmental standards
- **Timeline**: The executive order was effective immediately on January 20, 2025, for flag protocols; the construction policy governs long-term procurement activities

The executive order contains no language that would modify, supersede, or impact construction solicitation procedures, environmental requirements, sustainability evaluation factors, or any other substantive elements of the IRA construction guidance.

### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance

No compliance actions are required as the executive order does not affect the construction solicitation policy. The GSA Construction Solicitation Desk Guide can continue to be implemented as written without any modifications related to this executive order.

**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",Not Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal construction procurement and environmental compliance under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, including sustainability evaluation factors and low embodied carbon construction materials requirements.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Ceremonial flag protocol requiring full-staff display on Inauguration Day at federal facilities.

3. **Impact Analysis**: No direct or indirect impact exists. The executive order addresses purely ceremonial matters with no substantive policy implications for construction procurement. The domains are functionally isolated - flag display protocols cannot influence technical evaluation factors, material specifications, or procurement procedures outlined in the IRA Construction Solicitation Desk Guide.

4. **Supporting Language**:","**Step 1: Policy Domain Identification**
The policy is focused on **federal construction procurement and environmental compliance**, specifically implementing the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022's requirements for construction solicitations. It addresses sustainability evaluation factors, low embodied carbon (LEC) construction materials, technical evaluation criteria, and procurement processes for federal construction projects.

**Step 2: Executive Order Domain Identification**
The executive order is focused on **ceremonial flag protocol**, specifically mandating that the U.S. flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day at all federal facilities, including the White House, public buildings, military installations, and naval vessels.

**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**
These are entirely distinct policy domains with no operational overlap:
- The policy governs complex procurement procedures, environmental standards, and construction material requirements
- The executive order establishes a simple ceremonial protocol for flag display on a specific day

There is no mechanism by which flag display requirements would influence construction procurement processes, sustainability evaluations, or material specifications. The executive order contains no provisions that would modify, supersede, or interact with construction solicitation procedures.

**Step 4: Independent Assessment**
While both documents relate to federal government operations, they operate in completely separate spheres with no functional connection. The executive order's ceremonial nature and narrow scope (flag display protocol) cannot reasonably impact the substantive, technical requirements of construction procurement guidance.

**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal construction procurement and environmental compliance under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, including sustainability evaluation factors and low embodied carbon construction materials requirements.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Ceremonial flag protocol requiring full-staff display on Inauguration Day at federal facilities.

3. **Impact Analysis**: No direct or indirect impact exists. The executive order addresses purely ceremonial matters with no substantive policy implications for construction procurement. The domains are functionally isolated - flag display protocols cannot influence technical evaluation factors, material specifications, or procurement procedures outlined in the IRA Construction Solicitation Desk Guide.

4. **Supporting Language**: The executive order contains no language referencing construction, procurement, environmental standards, or any operational aspects that would intersect with the policy's technical requirements for sustainability evaluations and construction material compliance.

5. **Edge Cases Considered**: Even considering the broadest possible interpretation, there is no reasonable pathway by which ceremonial flag requirements could affect construction solicitation procedures, environmental compliance standards, or procurement evaluation criteria. The executive order's scope is definitively limited to flag display protocol.

The phase1_flag assessment of ""Not Affected"" is correct and should be maintained."

Purpose TRACY M. MARCINOWSKI ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OFFICE OF ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT (PQ) Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) Review and Approval Process The purpose of this Procurement Instructional Bulletin (PIB) is to provide guidance on requesting Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval of certain contract actions. 2. Background This PIB supplements the policies and procedures concerning acquisitions and contract actions requiring SPE review or approval in accordance with General Services Administration Acquisition Manual (GSAM) 504.7104 and the guidance provided on the Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) SPE Review and Approval page on InSite . The below are common examples where SPE approval is required: i. Class Deviations - Class deviations to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) at any dollar value are approved by the SPE, unless otherwise delegated, in accordance with GSAM 501.404. ii. Consolidation and Bundling Determinations - The SPE is required to approve all consolidation, bundling, and substantial bundling analyses in accordance with GSAR 507.107.

Instructions and Procedures 8.A. SPE Acquisition Review Briefing (ARB) Request 8.A.1 When To Conduct an ARB An ARB with the SPE must be conducted as early in the acquisition life cycle as possible (e.g. market research phase) to identify any issues up front and to help expedite the final approval . The ARB should occur prior to the preparation of the document that will need the SPE s signature. 8.A.2 Preparing for the ARB The ARBs should focus on high-level considerations, covering the topics identified at GSAM 504.7102(d). The contracting activity shall prepare slides in advance in Google slides using this ARB Template . Do not edit the template. Instead, make a copy of the template. Since the slides will be shared with the SPE in advance, the contracting activity should not expect to read the slides during the ARB. Rather, the contracting activity should expect a dialogue with the SPE. PIB 21-04 2 The contracting activity shall mark presentation slides with source selection information in accordance with FAR Subpart 3.104-4(c). The ARB will be scheduled for one hour . Attachment 1 identifies the individuals who will be invited to the ARB. 8.A.3 How to Request an ARB When a contracting activity has identified the need for an ARB with the SPE, they shall submit an email to the PBS Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) Policy and Programs Division (PQA), at pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov with the following information: (1) Description of the need for SPE involvement (e.g., SPE approval of a consolidation determination); (2) Description of the requirement, including key milestones (e.g., anticipated solicitation date, anticipated award date); (3) Suggested date(s) of acquisition review(s); (4) ARB slides ( in Google slides using this ARB Template ); (5) A list of regional attendees (see Attachment 1 for attendee list); and (6) Any other important information. Requests to OAM for an ARB with the SPE should be made at least fifteen business days prior to the suggested date of the ARB. Within five business days of receiving the request, OAM will:   Send an email to spe.request@gsa.gov with the information contained in GSAM 504.7104(b);   Send out a calendar invitation for the ARB to all required and optional attendees; and   Coordinate with Central Office OGC on review and comments, and provide any comments to the contracting activity. All of the information provided, including the slides, will be reviewed by OAM prior to sharing with the SPE. Once any comments have been addressed, OAM will add the slides and any draft documents to the calendar invitation. Draft documents are not required for an ARB, and any draft documents provided will still need to go through a formal SPE review and approval process after the ARB. PIB 21-04 3 8.A.4 Special Considerations for Consolidation and Bundling Determinations Consolidation and Bundling Determinations require an understanding of the consolidation and bundling process, understanding of a  new requirement  , 1 in-depth market research, early coordination with the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), and an analysis of cost savings prior to the scheduling of an ARB with the SPE. See Attachment 2 for best practices for consolidation and bundling determination reviews. 8.A.5 ARB Summary Within five business days after the ARB, OAM will provide a summary to all attendees that will include any recommendations and action items. 8.B. SPE Final Document Approval 8.B.1 OAM Routing Following the SPE ARB, after a contracting activity has prepared the document requiring SPE review and received all regional-level concurrences, they shall submit the document for OAM review to pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov with the following information: (1) Description of the requirement, action required, and due date; (2) Separate the signature page from the rest of the document. This will allow changes to be made without having to go through the entire signature approval process again; Unless there are significant changes ( e.g., changes that materially impact the acquisition strategy and opportunities relating to small business, competition, category management) , documents do not always have to be rerouted for signature. Provided as an attachment to this PIB is a document routing template that can be modified and used, as appropriate; however, a signed pdf should be submitted; 1 To determine if the expansion or modification of an existing requirement would be considered a  new  requirement, several factors must be considered: (1) Whether the scope has changed significantly, requiring different types of work or capabilities; (2) Whether the magnitude or value of the requirement has changed significantly, such as greater than 25 percent; (3) Whether the end use of the requirement has changed; and (4) Whether the requirements have meaningfully changed, such as new technical specifications, different delivery schedules, or new performance locations.  New  requirements would not have been previously provided and would not meet the definition of consolidation or bundling; therefore, new requirements do not require a written determination. See Consolidation and Bundling FAQs for additional information. PIB 21-04 4 (3) Share the main body of the document as a Google document to enable reviewers to easily enter comments or suggested edits (or utilize a comment matrix if more practical for the circumstances and document type(s)) ; (4) Supporting attachments, if applicable; (5) Any other important information. OAM will coordinate with the Central Office OGC on review and comments, and will provide any comments to the contracting activity within five business days of receiving the information. Once comments from OAM/OGC have been addressed (if any), OAM/OGC will sign the document and OAM will return the document to the contracting activity. 8.B.2 SPE Routing The contracting activity shall follow the procedures in GSAM 504.7104(c) and OGP s Step 2 - Final Document Approval and submit the required email to the SPE at spe.request@gsa.gov and, if necessary, OSDBU at osdbu_review_concurrence@gsa.gov with a carbon copy to OAM at pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov . 9. Point of Contact Any questions regarding the PIB may be addressed to the PBS Office of Acquisition Management at pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov . 10.

Background. Lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American interests should not have access to our Nation s secrets, nor should their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts. My Administration must also take appropriate and nec- essary measures to guard against the actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that arise when the Government funds, engages with, or otherwise devotes resources to law firms and their clients that engage in conduct undermining critical American interests and priorities. I have determined that action is necessary to address the significant risks, egregious conduct, and conflicts of interest associated with Susman Godfrey LLP (Susman). Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections. Susman also funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military through the injection of political and radical ideology, and it supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race. Susman itself engages in unlawful discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race. For example, Susman administers a program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities only to  students of color.  My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimi- nation perpetrated in the name of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec. 2. Security Clearance Review. (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applica- ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Susman, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Susman. The heads of agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec. 3. Contracting. (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Susman and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with Susman or with entities that disclose doing business with Susman under subsection (a) of this section. To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall: VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:25 Apr 14, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\FR\FM\15APE0.SGM 15APE0 0 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l 15616 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 71 / Tuesday, April 15, 2025 / Presidential Documents (i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Susman has been hired to perform any service; and (ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Susman or with entities that do business with Susman effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. Sec. 4. Racial Discrimination. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP). Sec. 5. Personnel. (a) The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Susman when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Susman employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States. (b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Susman, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

1. Policy Summary (PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04):
This document provides guidance on the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval process for Public Buildings Service (PBS) acquisitions. It outlines procedures for Acquisition Review Briefings (ARBs) and final document approvals, focusing on specific contract actions requiring SPE oversight.

2. Executive Order Summary:
The executive order targets Susman Godfrey LLP, alleging the law firm engages in activities detrimental to American interests. The order mandates:
- Suspension of security clearances for Susman employees
- Review and potential termination of government contracts
- Limitations on government interactions with Susman employees
- Disclosure requirements for contractors doing business with Susman

3. Applicability Analysis:
The executive order does NOT directly impact the PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04. The policy is a procedural guide for SPE review processes and does not specifically relate to Susman Godfrey LLP or the actions outlined in the executive order.

4. Compliance Recommendations:
While the policy is not directly affected, GSA procurement teams should:
- Review current contracts for any potential interactions with Susman Godfrey LLP
- Ensure contract disclosure requirements are updated to reflect the new executive order
- Communicate the executive order's requirements to procurement staff
- Modify standard contract templates to include new disclosure provisions
- Conduct a comprehensive review of existing contracts for potential compliance issues

Key Takeaway: The policy remains valid, but procurement practices should be reviewed to align with the new executive order's requirements.

Recommendation: Consult with GSA legal counsel for a definitive interpretation and potential policy updates.",Affected,Affected,"The executive order introduces new contracting requirements and disclosure mandates that will necessitate modifications to existing procurement procedures, particularly around contract management and vendor interactions. These changes directly impact the PBS procurement policy's implementation, thus marking it as affected.",Affected,"## Policy Analysis: Impact of Executive Order 14263 on PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04

### 1. Brief Summary of the Policy Text

PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04 establishes guidance for requesting Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval of certain contract actions within GSA's Public Buildings Service. The policy outlines four main categories requiring SPE approval: (1) Class deviations from Federal Acquisition Regulation or GSA Acquisition Regulation, (2) Consolidation and bundling determinations, (3) Justifications for non-competitive procurements over $75 million, and (4) Cost Accounting Standards waiver requests. This is procedural guidance that supplements existing acquisition policies and establishes approval workflows for significant contracting decisions.

### 2. Brief Summary of the Executive Order Text

Executive Order 14263 targets Susman Godfrey LLP specifically, prohibiting this law firm from accessing government secrets and receiving federal taxpayer funds or contracts. The order cites concerns about the firm's alleged activities that ""undermine critical American interests,"" including weaponizing the legal system, degrading election quality, undermining military effectiveness through political ideology, and engaging in unlawful racial discrimination. The order reflects the Administration's commitment to ending discrimination perpetrated under diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and ensuring federal benefits support U.S. laws and national security interests.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability

This Executive Order **does apply** to the PBS procurement policy, though indirectly. While PIB 21-04 itself is procedural guidance for approval processes, it governs contract actions that could potentially involve Susman Godfrey LLP or similar entities targeted by the Executive Order.

**Key points of intersection:**
- The PIB establishes approval processes for contract actions, including justifications for non-competitive procurements over $75 million
- The Executive Order prohibits federal contracts with Susman Godfrey LLP
- GSA contracting officers operating under PIB 21-04 must now consider Executive Order restrictions when evaluating potential contractors
- The SPE review process outlined in PIB 21-04 should incorporate screening for entities prohibited under Executive Order 14263

**Scope of Impact:**
- PIB 21-04's approval processes remain valid but must now include compliance screening
- Any contract action requiring SPE approval must verify the contractor is not Susman Godfrey LLP
- The procedural framework doesn't need fundamental changes, but implementation must incorporate the Executive Order's restrictions

### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Update screening procedures**: Incorporate Executive Order 14263 restrictions into all SPE approval processes outlined in PIB 21-04
2. **Contractor verification**: Establish procedures to verify that entities seeking contracts are not Susman Godfrey LLP or its affiliates
3. **Staff training**: Educate acquisition personnel on the Executive Order's requirements and how they interface with existing SPE approval processes
4. **Review existing contracts**: Audit current contracts to identify any existing relationships with Susman Godfrey LLP

**Documentation Updates:**
1. Issue supplementary guidance to PIB 21-04 referencing Executive Order 14263 compliance requirements
2. Update SPE approval checklists to include Executive Order screening
3. Revise procurement templates to incorporate necessary compliance certifications
4. Establish tracking mechanisms for Executive Order compliance in the approval workflow

**Ongoing Compliance:**
1. Monitor for additional entities that may be subject to similar restrictions
2. Regular review of compliance procedures effectiveness
3. Coordinate with GSA legal counsel on implementation questions
4. Report compliance status through appropriate channels

**Final Determination: [Affected]**",Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: The PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04 governs federal procurement processes, specifically SPE review and approval procedures for contract actions within GSA's Public Buildings Service.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: EO 14263 establishes national security-based restrictions on federal contracting with certain law firms, particularly those engaging in activities ""detrimental to critical American interests.""

3. **Direct Impact Analysis**: The executive order directly impacts the policy because:
   - The SPE review and approval process must now incorporate additional screening criteria for law firm contractors
   - Contract actions involving restricted law firms would require enhanced scrutiny under the SPE approval framework
   - The policy's procedures ","**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**
The policy (PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04) operates in the domain of **federal procurement and acquisition management**. Specifically, it establishes procedures for Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval of certain contract actions within the General Services Administration's Public Buildings Service, including class deviations from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**
Executive Order 14263 operates in the domain of **national security and federal contracting restrictions**. It specifically addresses risks from law firms (particularly Susman Godfrey) that may engage in activities detrimental to American interests, establishing restrictions on their access to federal contracts and taxpayer funds.

**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**
Both domains intersect significantly within **federal procurement and contracting**. The executive order directly impacts how federal agencies, including GSA's PBS, must evaluate and approve contracts with certain law firms. This creates a direct operational impact on the SPE review and approval processes outlined in the policy.

**Step 4: Independent Assessment Context**
While the phase1_flag indicates ""Affected,"" my independent analysis confirms this determination based on the substantive overlap between procurement oversight and contractor eligibility restrictions.

**Final Decision: [Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: The PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 21-04 governs federal procurement processes, specifically SPE review and approval procedures for contract actions within GSA's Public Buildings Service.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: EO 14263 establishes national security-based restrictions on federal contracting with certain law firms, particularly those engaging in activities ""detrimental to critical American interests.""

3. **Direct Impact Analysis**: The executive order directly impacts the policy because:
   - The SPE review and approval process must now incorporate additional screening criteria for law firm contractors
   - Contract actions involving restricted law firms would require enhanced scrutiny under the SPE approval framework
   - The policy's procedures for ""Class Deviations"" and contract approvals must account for the new eligibility restrictions

4. **Supporting Language**: Key provisions include:
   - EO: ""Lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American interests should not have access to our Nation's secrets, nor should their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts""
   - Policy: Establishes ""guidance on requesting Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) review and approval of certain contract actions""
   - The policy's reference to GSAM 504.7104 indicates it governs acquisition procedures that would be directly affected by contractor eligibility restrictions

5. **Implementation Considerations**: The PBS will need to modify its SPE review procedures to incorporate the executive order's restrictions, potentially requiring additional documentation, enhanced due diligence, and modified approval workflows when evaluating contracts with law firms.

The executive order creates new mandatory considerations that directly alter how the SPE review and approval process outlined in the policy must be implemented, making this a clear case of direct operational impact."

Purpose. This Order provides an implementation framework for GSA s response to the ongoing climate crisis, through activities intended to (a) achieve  net zero  operational and procurement-related carbon emissions and (b) adapt GSA facilities, operations, and supply chains to withstand observed and expected climate conditions. 2. Background. a. Executive Order 14057,  Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability,  ( E.O. 14057 ) signed on December 8, 2021, along with its accompanying OMB Order M-22-06 and White House Council https://insite.gsa.gov/directives-library/prioritizing-gsa-response-to-the-climate-crisis 1/2 2/6/25, 2:21 PM Prioritizing GSA Response to the Climate Crisis on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Implementing Instructions, notes that  the Federal Government faces broad exposure to the mounting risks and costs already posed by the climate crisis.  In response, E.O. 14057 directs numerous specific agency actions in furtherance of seven government-wide goals including: (i) 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030, including 50 percent 24/7 carbon pollution-free electricity; (ii) 100 percent zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035, including 100 percent zero-emission light-duty vehicle acquisitions by 2027; (iii) a net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045, including a 50 percent emissions reduction by 2032; (iv) a 65 percent reduction in scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from Federal operations by 2030 from 2008 levels; (v) net- zero emissions from Federal procurement; (vi) climate resilient infrastructure and operations; and (vii) a climate- and sustainability-focused Federal workforce.

Purpose and Policy. The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government. The injection of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  (DEI) into our institutions has corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy. Orders to open the borders have endangered the American people and dissolved Federal, State, and local resources that should be used to benefit the American people. Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation. To commence the policies that will make our Nation united, fair, safe, and prosperous again, it is the policy of the United States to restore common sense to the Federal Government and unleash the potential of the American citizen. The revocations within this order will be the first of many steps the United States Federal Government will take to repair our institutions and our economy. Sec. 2. Revocation of Orders and Actions. The following executive actions are hereby revoked: (a) Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Govern- ment).

1. Policy Summary (GSA Order ADM 1100.1):
The policy focuses on GSA's response to the climate crisis, specifically:
- Achieving net zero operational and procurement-related carbon emissions
- Adapting GSA facilities, operations, and supply chains to withstand climate conditions
- Implementing Executive Order 14057's sustainability goals, including:
  * 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030
  * 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035
  * Net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045
  * 65% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030

2. Executive Order Summary (Executive Order 14148):
The order systematically revokes numerous previous executive orders, including:
- Executive Order 14057 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability)
- Executive Order 14008 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad)
- Several other climate and sustainability-related executive orders

3. Policy Applicability Analysis:
The executive order directly impacts GSA Order ADM 1100.1 by:
- Revoking the foundational Executive Order 14057
- Effectively nullifying the legal basis for the current climate crisis response policy
- Signaling a potential complete reversal of previous climate-focused federal policies

4. Recommended Compliance Steps:
- Immediately pause implementation of current climate sustainability initiatives
- Await specific guidance from senior leadership
- Prepare to potentially redesign or suspend the current climate response framework
- Maintain existing infrastructure and operational capabilities
- Develop contingency plans for potential policy restructuring

The order represents a comprehensive rescission of climate-related federal initiatives, which fundamentally impacts the GSA's existing climate response policy.",Not Affected,"## Policy Analysis: Impact of Executive Order 14148 on GSA Order 1100.1

### 1. Brief Summary of the Policy Text

GSA Order 1100.1 ""Prioritizing GSA Response to the Climate Crisis"" (effective January 25, 2023) establishes an implementation framework for GSA's climate response activities. The policy aims to achieve ""net zero"" operational and procurement-related carbon emissions and adapt GSA facilities, operations, and supply chains to climate conditions. It references Executive Order 14057 ""Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability"" and outlines specific federal sustainability goals including 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030, 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035, net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045, and 65% reduction in scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

### 2. Brief Summary of the Executive Order Text

Executive Order 14148 ""Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions"" (January 20, 2025) states that the previous administration embedded ""unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices"" including ""climate extremism"" that has ""exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation."" The order aims to ""restore common sense to the Federal Government"" and revokes several executive orders, though the provided excerpt only shows revocations of EOs 13985, 13986, and 13987 (related to racial equity, census, and COVID-19 response).

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability

Based on the provided excerpts, this executive order does **not directly affect** GSA Order 1100.1. Here's the analysis:

**Direct Impact:** The executive order explicitly revokes only three specific executive orders (13985, 13986, 13987), none of which is Executive Order 14057 that serves as the foundation for GSA Order 1100.1.

**Indirect Considerations:** While the executive order's preamble contains strong language against ""climate extremism,"" it does not provide a comprehensive list of all revoked orders in the excerpt provided. The order mentions this will be ""the first of many steps,"" suggesting additional revocations may follow.

**Policy Foundation:** GSA Order 1100.1 derives its authority from Executive Order 14057 (December 8, 2021), which is not explicitly revoked in the provided text. Without the revocation of EO 14057, the legal foundation for GSA Order 1100.1 remains intact.

### 4. Next Steps for Compliance

Since the policy does not appear to be directly affected by the current executive order:

1. **Monitor for Additional Orders:** Given the ""first of many steps"" language, closely monitor for subsequent executive orders that may specifically revoke EO 14057 or directly address climate-related policies.

2. **Maintain Current Implementation:** Continue implementing GSA Order 1100.1 as written until receiving explicit direction to cease or modify activities.

3. **Prepare for Potential Changes:** Begin scenario planning for potential policy modifications or suspensions of climate-related initiatives.

4. **Seek Clarification:** Coordinate with GSA leadership and Office of General Counsel to confirm interpretation and await further guidance from the new administration.

5. **Review Full Executive Order:** Obtain and review the complete text of EO 14148 to ensure no additional relevant revocations were omitted from the provided excerpt.

**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**

*Note: This determination is based on the provided excerpts. The full text of EO 14148 should be reviewed to confirm no additional climate-related revocations are included.*",Not Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: GSA Order 1100.1ADM operates in federal climate action and sustainability, establishing frameworks for net-zero emissions and climate adaptation across GSA operations.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: EO 14148 focuses on rescinding previous administration policies, with explicit targeting of ""climate extremism"" and associated regulations.

3. **Direct Impact Analysis**: The executive order creates direct impact through:
   - Explicit condemnation of ""climate extremism"" that has ""exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation""
   - Broad authority to rescind ""harmful"" practices ""within every agency""
   - Clear intent to reverse climate-focused initiatives from the previous administration

4. **Supporting Language**: Key phrases like ""climate extremis","**Step 1: Policy Domain Identification**
The policy (GSA Order 1100.1ADM) operates in the **climate action and federal sustainability** domain. It specifically focuses on GSA's response to climate change through achieving ""net zero"" operational and procurement-related carbon emissions and adapting facilities/operations to climate conditions. The policy references Executive Order 14057 ""Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability"" as its foundation.

**Step 2: Executive Order Domain Identification**
Executive Order 14148 operates in the **administrative reform and policy rescission** domain. It targets what it characterizes as ""harmful"" policies from the previous administration, specifically calling out ""climate extremism"" as having ""exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation.""

**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**
There is a **direct and substantial overlap** between these domains. EO 14148 explicitly identifies ""climate extremism"" as a harmful practice that needs to be addressed, while GSA Order 1100.1ADM represents exactly the type of climate-focused federal sustainability initiative that would fall under this characterization.

**Step 4: Independent Assessment**
Despite the initial ""Not Affected"" flag, the evidence strongly suggests direct impact. EO 14148's broad language about rescinding ""harmful"" climate-related practices, combined with its stated purpose of removing ""radical practices within every agency,"" creates immediate uncertainty about the continued validity of climate-focused orders like GSA 1100.1ADM.

**Final Decision: [Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: GSA Order 1100.1ADM operates in federal climate action and sustainability, establishing frameworks for net-zero emissions and climate adaptation across GSA operations.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: EO 14148 focuses on rescinding previous administration policies, with explicit targeting of ""climate extremism"" and associated regulations.

3. **Direct Impact Analysis**: The executive order creates direct impact through:
   - Explicit condemnation of ""climate extremism"" that has ""exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation""
   - Broad authority to rescind ""harmful"" practices ""within every agency""
   - Clear intent to reverse climate-focused initiatives from the previous administration

4. **Supporting Language**: Key phrases like ""climate extremism,"" ""overburdened businesses with regulation,"" and the sweeping mandate to remove ""radical practices within every agency"" directly encompass the type of comprehensive climate response framework established by GSA Order 1100.1ADM.

5. **Nuances Considered**: While EO 14148 doesn't specifically name GSA Order 1100.1ADM, its categorical approach to climate policies and broad rescission authority creates immediate regulatory uncertainty. The GSA order's foundation on EO 14057 (from the previous administration) and its comprehensive climate response mandate align precisely with the type of policies EO 14148 characterizes as harmful ""climate extremism.""

The initial ""Not Affected"" assessment appears to have missed the direct connection between EO 14148's anti-climate regulation stance and the GSA order's climate-focused mandates."

Purpose The purpose of this Procurement Instructional Bulletin (PIB) is to outline the guidelines for implementation and use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool. 2. Background The Skill Enhancement & Employee Development (SEED) program was created to provide the 1102 contract specialist community with a solid foundation, minimize acquisition skill gaps, and increase the overall knowledge and skills of the acquisition workforce. As part of SEED, the PATH tool was developed to give those in the 1102 acquisition community with little to no contracting knowledge a tool to learn and test their knowledge using scenario based exercises. The tool consists of various exercises categorized into the following modules: Pre-Award, Award, Post-Award, and Other. 3. Effective Date This PIB is effective on the date signed. The exercises that make up the training tool will be updated, as needed, to address any regulatory changes or Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) policy guidance 1800 F Street, NW Washington, DC 20405-0002 www.gsa.gov DocuSign Envelope ID: 3DF787F3-F9CB-4240-B6F6-E46C4D13456610/28/2022 revisions. 4. Cancellation Date This PIB will remain in effect until canceled. 5. Affected or Canceled Policies None. 6. Applicability This PIB applies to all Public Buildings Service (PBS) 1102s, including interns hired under the PBS Acquisition Intern Program. Use of the PATH tool is mandatory for new employees at the GS-09 level and below who are hired on or after the effective date of this tool. The tool is optional for those employees above the GS-09 level. 7. Exceptions The requirements of this PIB will not be applicable to employees who are participating under the Emerging Leaders Program (ELP), until they are converted to the 1102 series. 8. Instructions and Procedures Exercises & Answer Keys The exercises are broken into four modules: Pre-award, Award, Post-Award, and Other. There are two documents for each topic: the exercise and answer key. Links to all of the documents can be found on Attachment 1 - PATH Tool Table of Contents. Users should complete the exercises in chronological order. Some exercises have a service and construction type scenario. In those cases, users can elect to complete one or both exercises. The users will access the exercise, read the scenario, if one is included, and use the policy and guidance references to answer the questions. Only the regional supervisors will have access to the answer key documents. Upon completion of each exercise, users must work with their supervisor, or designee, to review their responses and compare them to the answer key. This will help ensure that users understand the general concepts of the exercise topic. 2 DocuSign Envelope ID: 3DF787F3-F9CB-4240-B6F6-E46C4D134566 New employees will be expected to complete the entire tool within 18 months of their start date. At a minimum, the first module (Pre-Award) is to be completed within the first year. FAI CSOD & CLPs Upon completion of all exercises in a module, users are to ensure that their completion is indicated in FAI Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD). To do this, supervisors are to complete the survey form linked as Attachment 2 - PATH Tool Supervisor Confirmation of Completion. Upon receipt, OAM will update FAI CSOD. This must be done for completion of each module. OAM will use this information to track completion of the tool. This process will also assist to provide continuous learning points (CLPs) to users who are eligible to receive them. 9.

- Ordering the US flag to be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day
- Returning to half-staff afterward in recognition of President Carter's passing
- Applies to federal buildings, military posts, naval stations, and US embassies

3. Applicability Analysis:
The executive order does NOT directly impact the PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 23-01. The proclamation is solely about flag flying protocols and does not:
- Modify training requirements
- Change acquisition workforce policies
- Affect the PATH tool implementation
- Introduce any procedural changes for GSA acquisition personnel

4. Compliance Recommendation:
No immediate action is required. The PBS can continue implementing the PATH tool training as originally outlined in the Procurement Instructional Bulletin.

Recommendation: File this executive order in standard documentation without requiring policy modifications.",Not affected,Not Affected,"The Executive Order (Proclamation 10885) regarding flag flying protocols has no operational, procedural, or administrative impact on the PBS Procurement Training Instructional Bulletin 23-01. The two documents address fundamentally different organizational domains with no meaningful intersection.",Not Affected,"## Policy Analysis Summary

### 1. Brief Summary of the Policy Text
GSA Public Buildings Service Procurement Instructional Bulletin 23-01 establishes mandatory use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool for the acquisition workforce. The policy requires all PBS 1102 contract specialists at GS-09 level and below hired after the effective date to complete scenario-based training exercises covering Pre-Award, Award, Post-Award, and Other acquisition modules. The training is part of the SEED program designed to enhance acquisition skills and minimize knowledge gaps in the contracting community.

### 2. Brief Summary of the Executive Order Text
Presidential Proclamation 10885 of January 20, 2025, orders that the U.S. flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day (and all future Inauguration Days) at all federal facilities including the White House, public buildings and grounds, military installations, naval stations, vessels, embassies, and consular offices. After Inauguration Day ends, the flag returns to half-staff per previous Proclamation 10876 honoring former President Carter until the 30-day mourning period concludes.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability
This executive order does **not apply** to the PBS acquisition training policy. The executive order addresses flag display protocols on federal properties and has no intersection with personnel training requirements, acquisition procedures, or workforce development policies. The executive order is a ceremonial directive concerning flag etiquette, while the PBS policy governs internal training mandates for acquisition personnel. These are entirely separate regulatory domains with no overlapping provisions or requirements.

### 4. Next Steps for Compliance
No compliance actions are required as the executive order does not affect this policy. GSA PBS should continue implementing the PATH training requirements as outlined in PIB 23-01 without modification.

**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",Not Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal acquisition workforce training and development, specifically mandatory use of the PATH training tool for GSA PBS contract specialists (1102 series employees).

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Ceremonial flag display protocols requiring full-staff flag display on Inauguration Day at federal facilities and military installations.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact between these domains. The executive order's flag display requirements do not alter, modify, or interact with procurement training mandates. The policy's training requirements for acquisition personnel have no bearing on ceremonial flag protocols.

4. **Supporting Language**: The policy text focuses exclusively on ""guidelines for implementation and use of the Professional","**Step 1: Identify the domain or subject area of the policy**
The policy (PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 23-01) falls within the domain of federal acquisition/procurement training and workforce development. Specifically, it establishes mandatory use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool for GSA's Public Buildings Service 1102 contract specialists to enhance their acquisition skills and knowledge.

**Step 2: Identify the domain or subject area of the order**
The executive order (Proclamation 10885) falls within the domain of ceremonial/patriotic protocols and flag display requirements. It mandates that the U.S. flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day at all federal facilities, military installations, and naval vessels.

**Step 3: Compare both domains and assess impact**
These are entirely distinct domains with no operational overlap:
- The policy addresses internal workforce training and professional development for acquisition personnel
- The executive order addresses ceremonial flag display protocols for a specific national occasion

**Step 4: Independent assessment considering context**
The phase1_flag of ""Not Affected"" aligns with the clear separation between these policy areas. There is no mechanism by which a flag display requirement could impact procurement training protocols or vice versa.

**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal acquisition workforce training and development, specifically mandatory use of the PATH training tool for GSA PBS contract specialists (1102 series employees).

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Ceremonial flag display protocols requiring full-staff flag display on Inauguration Day at federal facilities and military installations.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact between these domains. The executive order's flag display requirements do not alter, modify, or interact with procurement training mandates. The policy's training requirements for acquisition personnel have no bearing on ceremonial flag protocols.

4. **Supporting Language**: The policy text focuses exclusively on ""guidelines for implementation and use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool"" and ""Skill Enhancement & Employee Development (SEED) program."" The executive order addresses only ""flying the flag of the United States at full-staff"" on federal properties during Inauguration Day.

5. **Edge Case Considerations**: Even though both apply to federal government operations, they operate in completely separate functional areas with no shared implementation requirements, affected personnel overlap in relevant duties, or operational dependencies. The ceremonial nature of the flag order does not intersect with the operational training requirements of the procurement policy.

The policies are functionally independent with no reasonable pathway for mutual influence or impact."

Policy. American citizens deserve an excellent and efficient Federal workforce that attracts the highest caliber of civil servants committed to achieving the freedom, prosperity, and democratic rule that our Constitution promotes. But current Federal hiring practices are broken, insular, and out- dated. They no longer focus on merit, practical skill, and dedication to our Constitution. Federal hiring should not be based on impermissible factors, such as one s commitment to illegal racial discrimination under the guise of  equity,  or one s commitment to the invented concept of  gender iden- tity  over sex. Inserting such factors into the hiring process subverts the will of the People, puts critical government functions at risk, and risks losing the best-qualified candidates. By making our recruitment and hiring processes more efficient and focused on serving the Nation, we will ensure that the Federal workforce is prepared to help achieve American greatness, and attracts the talent necessary to serve our citizens effectively. By significantly improving hiring principles and practices, Americans will receive the Federal resources and services they deserve from the highest-skilled Federal workforce in the world. Sec. 2. Federal Hiring Plan. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the Administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), shall develop and send to agency heads a Federal Hiring Plan that brings to the Federal workforce only highly skilled Americans dedicated to the furtherance of American ideals, values, and interests. (b) This Federal Hiring Plan shall: (i) prioritize recruitment of individuals committed to improving the effi- ciency of the Federal government, passionate about the ideals of our American republic, and committed to upholding the rule of law and the United States Constitution; (ii) prevent the hiring of individuals based on their race, sex, or religion, and prevent the hiring of individuals who are unwilling to defend the Constitution or to faithfully serve the Executive Branch; (iii) implement, to the greatest extent possible, technical and alternative assessments as required by the Chance to Compete Act of 2024; (iv) decrease government-wide time-to-hire to under 80 days; (v) improve communication with candidates to provide greater clarity regarding application status, timelines, and feedback, including regular updates on the progress of applications and explanations of hiring decisions where appropriate; (vi) integrate modern technology to support the recruitment and selection process, including the use of data analytics to identify trends, gaps, and VerDate Sep<11>2014 18:45 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\FR\FM\30JAE9.SGM 30JAE9 5 1 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l 8622 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents opportunities in hiring, as well as leveraging digital platforms to improve candidate engagement; and (vii) ensure Department and Agency leadership, or their designees, are active participants in implementing the new processes and throughout the full hiring process.

1. Policy Summary:
The GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) Sustainability Performance Order (PBS 1098.1) establishes comprehensive sustainability goals for federal buildings. Key objectives include:
- Reducing energy use, water use, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions
- Achieving net zero operational emissions by 2045
- Improving building performance across PBS's portfolio
- Implementing sustainable practices in acquisition, design, construction, facilities management, and leasing

2. Executive Order Summary:
Executive Order 14170 focuses on reforming the federal hiring process by:
- Developing a new Federal Hiring Plan within 120 days
- Prioritizing recruitment of individuals committed to government efficiency
- Decreasing time-to-hire to under 80 days
- Improving candidate communication and technology integration
- Ensuring leadership involvement in hiring processes

3. Applicability of Executive Order:
The executive order does NOT directly impact the substantive content of the PBS Sustainability Performance Policy. While the order addresses federal hiring practices, it does not modify:
- Sustainability goals
- Environmental performance requirements
- Existing PBS policy frameworks
- Sustainability implementation strategies

The executive order's hiring provisions may indirectly affect PBS by potentially changing recruitment strategies for sustainability-focused roles, but it does not fundamentally alter the policy's sustainability objectives.

4. Recommended Next Steps:
- Review current hiring practices for sustainability-related positions
- Ensure recruitment aligns with both the original sustainability policy and new hiring guidelines
- Maintain focus on recruiting qualified sustainability professionals
- Update position descriptions to reflect both technical sustainability requirements and new hiring principles
- Consult with HR to integrate new federal hiring guidelines while preserving subject matter expertise requirements

Conclusion: The sustainability policy remains largely unaffected by the executive order, with only potential minor adjustments to hiring processes needed.",Affected,Affected,"While Executive Order 14170 does not substantively change the PBS sustainability policy's environmental goals, its hiring reform provisions could influence how sustainability professionals are recruited and selected, thus warranting an ""Affected"" classification. The order may introduce new hiring principles that could marginally impact PBS's approach to staffing sustainability roles.",Not Affected,"## Policy Analysis: Impact of Executive Order 14170 on GSA PBS Order 1098.1

### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text
GSA PBS Order 1098.1 establishes the Public Buildings Service's commitment to sustainability performance across federal real property. The order sets ambitious environmental goals including reducing energy use, water consumption, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions while increasing all-electric buildings and achieving net zero operational emissions by 2045. The policy focuses on operational building performance, environmental stewardship, and sustainable federal facility management.

### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text
Executive Order 14170 reforms federal hiring processes with an emphasis on merit-based selection. The order explicitly prohibits hiring decisions based on what it terms ""impermissible factors,"" specifically targeting considerations related to ""equity"" (characterized as illegal racial discrimination) and ""gender identity."" The order mandates development of a Federal Hiring Plan within 120 days and aims to create a more efficient, merit-focused recruitment system.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability
This executive order does **not directly apply** to PBS Order 1098.1. The executive order specifically addresses federal hiring practices and recruitment processes, while the PBS order focuses on building sustainability performance and environmental goals.

However, there could be **indirect implications** in the following areas:

- **Implementation Personnel**: If PBS needs to hire sustainability specialists, energy managers, or environmental compliance officers to implement the sustainability goals, those hiring processes would need to comply with the new executive order requirements.

- **Contractor Selection**: While the executive order focuses on federal employee hiring, if similar principles are extended to contractor selection processes for sustainability projects, this could affect implementation.

- **Program Administration**: Any staffing decisions related to managing sustainability programs, compliance monitoring, or performance measurement would be subject to the new hiring requirements.

The core sustainability objectives, performance metrics, and operational requirements in PBS Order 1098.1 remain unchanged and unaffected by the hiring process reforms.

### 4. Next Steps for Compliance
Since the policy itself is not directly affected, minimal compliance actions are required:

1. **Monitor Implementation Guidance**: Watch for additional guidance on how merit-based hiring principles apply to specialized sustainability positions.

2. **Review Future Staffing Plans**: Ensure any hiring plans for sustainability program staff comply with the new merit-focused requirements when they are finalized.

3. **Coordinate with HR**: Work with GSA Human Resources to understand how the new hiring requirements affect recruitment for positions supporting sustainability goals.

4. **Document Current Practices**: Review existing hiring practices for sustainability-related positions to ensure alignment with merit-based principles.

**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",Not Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: PBS 1098.1 governs federal building sustainability and environmental performance, including energy use reduction, greenhouse gas emissions, water conservation, and achieving net-zero operational emissions by 2045.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: EO 14170 addresses federal hiring processes, merit-based selection, and personnel management practices, specifically targeting diversity and inclusion considerations in employment decisions.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact. The EO does not modify environmental regulations, sustainability standards, or building performance requirements. The policy's technical mandates for energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and sustainable building operations are unaffected by changes to hiring ","**Step 1: Policy Domain Identification**
The policy (PBS 1098.1) operates in the domain of **federal building sustainability and environmental performance management**. It focuses on energy efficiency, water conservation, waste reduction, greenhouse gas emissions, net-zero buildings, and overall environmental performance of GSA's real property portfolio.

**Step 2: Executive Order Domain Identification**
Executive Order 14170 operates in the domain of **federal human resources and personnel management**. It addresses hiring practices, merit-based selection, civil service reform, and elimination of certain diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations in federal employment decisions.

**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**
These domains are fundamentally distinct:
- **Policy Domain**: Environmental/sustainability management of physical infrastructure
- **EO Domain**: Human resources and hiring practices

The executive order does not contain any provisions that would directly modify environmental standards, building performance requirements, energy efficiency mandates, or sustainability metrics. The policy's core operational requirements (reducing emissions, achieving net-zero performance, improving asset efficiency) remain unchanged by hiring process reforms.

**Step 4: Independent Assessment**
While both documents govern federal operations, they operate in separate functional spheres with minimal overlap. The EO's focus on hiring practices does not intersect with the technical and operational requirements of building sustainability performance.

**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: PBS 1098.1 governs federal building sustainability and environmental performance, including energy use reduction, greenhouse gas emissions, water conservation, and achieving net-zero operational emissions by 2045.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: EO 14170 addresses federal hiring processes, merit-based selection, and personnel management practices, specifically targeting diversity and inclusion considerations in employment decisions.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact. The EO does not modify environmental regulations, sustainability standards, or building performance requirements. The policy's technical mandates for energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and sustainable building operations are unaffected by changes to hiring practices.

4. **Supporting Language**: The EO focuses exclusively on ""Federal hiring practices,"" ""merit,"" and ""civil servants,"" while the policy addresses ""energy use, water use, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions."" No provisions in the EO reference environmental performance, sustainability standards, or building operations.

5. **Edge Case Consideration**: While both documents govern federal operations, the functional separation between HR management and facilities/environmental management creates no meaningful intersection. Personnel changes resulting from new hiring practices would not alter the substantive environmental performance requirements established in the policy."

Purpose. Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single- sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women s domestic abuse shelters to women s workplace showers. This is wrong. Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system. Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself. This unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts. Invalidating the true and biological category of  woman  improperly trans- forms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept. Accordingly, my Administration will defend women s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male. Sec. 2. Policy and Definitions. It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Under my direc- tion, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpre- tation of and application of Federal law and administration policy: (a)  Sex  shall refer to an individual s immutable biological classification as either male or female.  Sex  is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of  gender identity.  (b)  Women  or  woman  and  girls  or  girl  shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively. (c)  Men  or  man  and  boys  or  boy  shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively. (d)  Female  means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell. (e)  Male  means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that pro- duces the small reproductive cell. (f)  Gender ideology  replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true.

Gender ideology is internally incon- sistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body. (g)  Gender identity  reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex. Sec. 3. Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men. (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order. (b) Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. Each agency should therefore give the terms  sex ,  male ,  female ,  men ,  women ,  boys  and  girls  the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications. (c) When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term  sex  and not  gender  in all applicable Federal policies and documents. (d) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees  sex, as defined by section 2 of this order. (e) Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, com- munications, or other internal and external messages that promote or other- wise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. Agency forms that require an individual s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity. Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology. (f) The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single- sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act. This position is legally untenable and has harmed women. The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities. In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent. (g) Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology. Sec. 4. Privacy in Intimate Spaces. (a) The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that males are not detained in women s prisons or housed in women s detention centers, including through amend- ment, as necessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act.

(c) The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate s appearance to that of the opposite sex. (d) Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity. Sec. 5. Protecting Rights. The Attorney General shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In accordance with that guidance, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the General Counsel and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act shall prioritize inves- tigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified. Sec. 6. Bill Text. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs shall present to the President proposed bill text to codify the definitions in this order. Sec. 7. Agency Implementation and Reporting. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, each agency head shall submit an update on implementa- tion of this order to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. That update shall address: (i) changes to agency documents, including regulations, guidance, forms, and communications, made to comply with this order; and (ii) agency-imposed requirements on federally funded entities, including contractors, to achieve the policy of this order. (b) The requirements of this order supersede conflicting provisions in any previous Executive Orders or Presidential Memoranda, including but not limited to Executive Orders 13988 of January 20, 2021, 14004 of January 25, 2021, 14020 and 14021 of March 8, 2021, and 14075 of June 15, 2022. These Executive Orders are hereby rescinded, and the White House Gender Policy Council established by Executive Order 14020 is dissolved.

1. Policy Summary:
The GSA COR (Contracting Officer's Representative) Desk Guide is a comprehensive manual for GSA employees managing building services contracts. It provides guidance on contract administration, responsibilities, documentation, and oversight across various service contract types.

2. Executive Order Summary:
Executive Order 14168 focuses on defining biological sex, restricting gender identity considerations in federal policy, and requiring agencies to use biological sex-based definitions in documentation, forms, and communications.

3. Impact Analysis:
While the Executive Order does not directly invalidate the entire COR Desk Guide, several sections would require review and potential modification:

Potential Affected Sections:
- Background Investigations (Chapter 3)
- Submittals and Deliverables (Chapter 4)
- Documentation (Chapter 5)

Specific Compliance Considerations:
- Forms and documentation must be updated to reflect biological sex
- References to gender identity in contractor personnel documentation may need revision
- Fitness determination processes might require modification to focus solely on biological sex

4. Recommended Next Steps:
a. Conduct a comprehensive policy review
b. Update forms and templates to remove gender identity references
c. Revise background investigation and personnel documentation procedures
d. Consult with GSA legal counsel for precise implementation guidance
e. Develop training for CORs on new documentation requirements
f. Update contract templates and evaluation criteria

Recommendation: A detailed, section-by-section review is necessary to ensure full compliance with the executive order's requirements.",Affected,Affected,"The executive order's explicit mandate to revise federal documentation and remove gender identity references would require comprehensive modifications to the COR Desk Guide's administrative processes, making it substantively affected by the new policy requirements.",Affected,"## Policy Analysis: GSA COR Desk Guide vs. Executive Order 14168

### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text
The provided text appears to be a header/title reference to the ""U.S. General Services Administration COR Desk Guide | Building Services Contracts Contract administration for PBS Contracting."" Based on this limited information, this appears to be an internal GSA guidance document for Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs) managing building services contracts under the Public Buildings Service (PBS). Without the full policy content, the analysis is limited to what can be reasonably inferred about typical COR desk guides, which generally contain procedural guidance for contract administration, performance monitoring, and compliance oversight.

### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order 14168
Executive Order 14168, titled ""Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,"" mandates that federal agencies use language and policies that recognize biological sex as binary and immutable. The order specifically targets policies that allow individuals to ""self-identify"" gender in ways that may affect access to sex-segregated spaces and activities. It requires federal policy to be based on ""biological reality"" rather than gender identity concepts.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability
The executive order would likely apply to the GSA COR Desk Guide if the document contains any of the following elements:

**Potentially Affected Areas:**
- Language referring to gender identity, gender expression, or transgender individuals
- Guidance on workplace facilities management (restrooms, changing areas, showers)
- Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) references related to LGBTQ+ protections
- Contractor diversity and inclusion requirements
- Workplace harassment and discrimination guidance
- Building access and security protocols that reference gender identity

**Likely Application Scenarios:**
Given that this is a building services contract guide, it may contain guidance on facility management that could include restroom access, locker rooms, or other sex-segregated facilities. If the current guidance references gender identity or allows for self-identification in facility access, these provisions would need to be revised under EO 14168.

**Uncertainty Due to Limited Text:**
Without the full policy content, it's difficult to make a definitive determination. However, most federal contracting guidance documents do contain some references to civil rights compliance, EEO requirements, or facility management that could be affected.

### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance (If Affected)
1. **Comprehensive Review**: Conduct a thorough review of the entire COR Desk Guide to identify any language referencing gender identity, LGBTQ+ protections, or sex-segregated facility access
2. **Language Revision**: Replace any references to ""gender identity"" with ""biological sex"" where applicable
3. **Facility Management Updates**: Revise any guidance on restroom, locker room, or other facility access to align with biological sex definitions
4. **Contractor Requirements**: Update any contractor compliance requirements to reflect the new federal position on biological sex
5. **Training Materials**: Revise associated training materials and presentations for CORs
6. **Stakeholder Notification**: Inform current contractors of any policy changes that affect their operations
7. **Legal Review**: Ensure all revisions comply with the executive order while maintaining consistency with other applicable laws

### Final Determination: [Affected]

*Note: This determination is based on the reasonable expectation that a comprehensive GSA contracting guide would contain references to civil rights compliance, facility management, or EEO requirements that would be subject to the executive order's mandates. A definitive determination would require review of the complete policy document.*",Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal procurement and contract administration for building services, including facility management and maintenance operations.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Federal employment policy and facility usage based on biological sex classifications, with specific attention to single-sex spaces.

3. **Direct Impact Analysis**: The executive order directly affects this policy because:
   - Building services contracts often include facility management responsibilities
   - Such contracts may need to incorporate new requirements regarding single-sex facility policies
   - COR guidance may require updates to ensure contractor compliance with the biological sex definitions and facility usage requirements
   - Contract specifications, performance standards, and oversight pr","**Step 1: Policy Domain Identification**
The policy ""COR Desk Guide | Building Services Contracts"" operates in the domain of federal contract administration and procurement, specifically focused on Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) responsibilities for building services contracts under the General Services Administration's Public Buildings Service (PBS).

**Step 2: Executive Order Domain Identification**
Executive Order 14168 operates in the domain of federal employment policy, civil rights, and gender/sex-based classifications. It specifically addresses biological sex definitions, single-sex facilities, and prohibits what it terms ""gender ideology extremism"" in federal operations.

**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**
While these domains appear distinct at first glance, there is a significant intersection. Building services contracts administered under GSA/PBS frequently involve facilities management, including maintenance and operation of federal buildings that contain restrooms, locker rooms, showers, and other single-sex facilities mentioned in the executive order.

**Step 4: Independent Assessment**
The executive order's broad scope affecting ""Federal Government"" operations and its specific focus on ""intimate single-sex spaces"" creates direct implications for building services contracts, which routinely address facility management policies and procedures.

**Final Decision: [Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal procurement and contract administration for building services, including facility management and maintenance operations.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Federal employment policy and facility usage based on biological sex classifications, with specific attention to single-sex spaces.

3. **Direct Impact Analysis**: The executive order directly affects this policy because:
   - Building services contracts often include facility management responsibilities
   - Such contracts may need to incorporate new requirements regarding single-sex facility policies
   - COR guidance may require updates to ensure contractor compliance with the biological sex definitions and facility usage requirements
   - Contract specifications, performance standards, and oversight procedures may need modification

4. **Supporting Language**: The EO's reference to ""women's workplace showers"" and other ""intimate single-sex spaces"" directly relates to facilities that building services contractors maintain and manage. The order's broad application to federal operations encompasses contract administration activities.

5. **Edge Cases Considered**: While the COR guide itself focuses on contract administration procedures rather than facility policies, the intersection occurs because building services contracts are the vehicle through which many federal facility policies are implemented and enforced. CORs would need updated guidance to ensure contractors comply with the new biological sex-based facility requirements.

The policy is affected because building services contract administration will likely require procedural updates to implement and oversee compliance with the executive order's facility-related mandates."

Background. Lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American interests should not have access to our Nation s secrets, nor should their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts. My Administration must also take appropriate and nec- essary measures to guard against the actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that arise when the Government funds, engages with, or otherwise devotes resources to law firms and their clients that engage in conduct undermining critical American interests and priorities. I have determined that action is necessary to address the significant risks, egregious conduct, and conflicts of interest associated with Susman Godfrey LLP (Susman). Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections. Susman also funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military through the injection of political and radical ideology, and it supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race. Susman itself engages in unlawful discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race. For example, Susman administers a program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities only to  students of color.  My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimi- nation perpetrated in the name of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec. 2. Security Clearance Review. (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applica- ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Susman, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Susman. The heads of agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec. 3. Contracting. (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Susman and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with Susman or with entities that disclose doing business with Susman under subsection (a) of this section.

(a) The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Susman when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Susman employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States.

1. GSA Policy Summary:
The document is a GSA Policy Statement on Harassment (Policy 2325.8A) that:
- Defines harassment in the federal workplace
- Establishes responsibilities for preventing harassment
- Applies to GSA employees, former employees, and employment applicants
- Covers sexual and non-sexual harassment
- Aims to maintain a workplace free from harassment
- Outlines reporting and investigation procedures

2. Executive Order Summary:
The executive order specifically targets Susman Godfrey LLP, alleging:
- Discriminatory practices
- Undermining national interests
- Potential risks to national security
- Directives to:
  - Review security clearances
  - Limit government contracts
  - Restrict government interactions
  - Limit hiring of employees from the targeted organization

3. Applicability Assessment:
The executive order does NOT directly impact the GSA Harassment Policy because:
- The order is narrowly focused on Susman Godfrey LLP
- The harassment policy is a general organizational standard
- The policy's core principles of preventing discrimination remain unchanged

4. Recommended Compliance Steps:
While no direct policy modifications are required, GSA should:
- Review the executive order for any broad implications
- Ensure current anti-harassment policies remain robust
- Maintain vigilance in preventing discrimination
- Continue standard harassment prevention training
- Monitor for any future related executive guidance

Recommendation: No immediate policy revision is necessary. Continue standard harassment prevention practices.",Not affected,Not Affected,"The executive order's narrow scope targeting a specific law firm does not substantively impact the GSA's broad anti-harassment policy framework, which remains unchanged in its core principles of preventing workplace discrimination and maintaining a respectful work environment.",Not Affected,"## Policy Analysis Summary

### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text

GSA Policy 2325.8A defines and establishes GSA's policy on harassment, including sexual harassment, non-sexual harassment, and sexual misconduct. The policy aims to maintain a workplace free from harassment by defining unwelcome conduct based on group membership and retaliation. It assigns responsibilities to the Office of Civil Rights for policy development, the Office of Human Resources Management for administering anti-harassment procedures, and managers/supervisors for maintaining harassment-free environments. **Note: This policy was cancelled on February 6, 2025.**

### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text

Executive Order 14263, signed April 9, 2025, targets Susman Godfrey LLP specifically, prohibiting federal engagement with the law firm due to alleged activities ""detrimental to critical American interests."" The order cites concerns about weaponizing the legal system, undermining elections and military effectiveness, and engaging in what the administration characterizes as ""unlawful discrimination"" through diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The order reflects broader opposition to race-conscious diversity programs and aims to prevent federal funding or contracts with entities engaging in such practices.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability

**This executive order does NOT directly apply to GSA Policy 2325.8A for several reasons:**

- **Scope Limitation**: The executive order specifically targets Susman Godfrey LLP and similar entities, not internal federal agency harassment policies
- **Policy Status**: GSA Policy 2325.8A was already cancelled on February 6, 2025, before the executive order was signed on April 9, 2025
- **Different Subject Matter**: The harassment policy focuses on preventing workplace harassment based on protected characteristics, while the executive order addresses federal contracting and engagement restrictions with specific external entities
- **Legal Framework**: The harassment policy operates under federal employment law and EEO requirements, while the executive order addresses procurement and national security concerns

However, there could be **indirect implications** if GSA's replacement harassment policy includes DEI-related language that the current administration might view as inconsistent with the executive order's anti-DEI stance.

### 4. Next Steps for Compliance

Since the policy is already cancelled, immediate compliance steps are:

1. **No Direct Action Required**: The cancelled status means this specific policy requires no modification
2. **Review Replacement Policy**: Examine any new harassment policy that replaced 2325.8A to ensure alignment with current administration priorities
3. **Monitor Implementation**: Ensure any new harassment policies focus on legally protected characteristics without language that could be construed as promoting race-conscious diversity programs
4. **Coordinate with OCR**: Work with the Office of Civil Rights to ensure harassment prevention efforts comply with both EEO requirements and current executive guidance

**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",Not Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: The GSA policy operates in the employment law/workplace conduct domain, establishing standards for harassment prevention and response within the federal workplace.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: The EO operates in the national security/federal contracting domain, specifically targeting restrictions on government engagement with Susman Godfrey law firm.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact between these domains. The EO's restrictions on contracting with a specific law firm do not alter, modify, or affect GSA's internal harassment policies, procedures, or workplace conduct standards. The harassment policy would continue to operate unchanged regardless of any restrictions placed on Susman Godfrey.

4. **Supporting Language**: The EO focuses","**Step 1: Policy Domain Identification**
The GSA Policy Statement 2325.8A ADM addresses workplace harassment prevention and response within the General Services Administration. This is an internal HR/employment policy focused on creating a harassment-free workplace environment for federal employees.

**Step 2: Executive Order Domain Identification**
Executive Order 14263 ""Addressing Risks From Susman Godfrey"" targets a specific law firm (Susman Godfrey) and addresses national security concerns, conflicts of interest, and restrictions on federal funding/contracting with law firms that allegedly engage in activities ""detrimental to critical American interests.""

**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**
These policies operate in entirely separate domains:
- **Policy Domain**: Internal workplace conduct and harassment prevention
- **EO Domain**: External contracting restrictions and national security measures targeting specific legal entities

The executive order focuses on limiting government engagement with a particular law firm based on perceived conflicts of interest and national security concerns. The GSA harassment policy governs internal employee conduct and workplace standards. There is no logical connection between restrictions on contracting with Susman Godfrey and GSA's internal harassment prevention procedures.

**Step 4: Independent Assessment**
The phase1_flag of ""Not Affected"" appears correct. The executive order's restrictions on a specific law firm have no bearing on GSA's internal policies regarding employee harassment, workplace conduct standards, or harassment response procedures.

**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: The GSA policy operates in the employment law/workplace conduct domain, establishing standards for harassment prevention and response within the federal workplace.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: The EO operates in the national security/federal contracting domain, specifically targeting restrictions on government engagement with Susman Godfrey law firm.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact between these domains. The EO's restrictions on contracting with a specific law firm do not alter, modify, or affect GSA's internal harassment policies, procedures, or workplace conduct standards. The harassment policy would continue to operate unchanged regardless of any restrictions placed on Susman Godfrey.

4. **Supporting Language**: The EO focuses on ""Federal taxpayer funds or contracts"" and ""conflicts of interest"" with external entities, while the policy addresses ""unwelcome conduct"" and ""workplace free from harassment"" - completely different operational spheres.

5. **Edge Cases Considered**: Even if Susman Godfrey had previously provided legal services to GSA on harassment matters, the EO would only restrict future contracting, not invalidate existing internal harassment policies or procedures. The policy's substantive content and implementation remain unaffected by external contracting restrictions."

1. Policy Summary (GSA Order ADM 1100.1):
This policy focuses on GSA's response to the climate crisis, establishing a framework to:
- Achieve net zero operational and procurement-related carbon emissions
- Adapt GSA facilities, operations, and supply chains to climate conditions
- Implement Executive Order 14057's sustainability goals, including:
  - 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030
  - 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035
  - Net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045
  - 65% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030
  - Climate-resilient infrastructure and operations

2. Executive Order Summary:
The document is a Presidential Proclamation regarding flag-flying protocols on Inauguration Day, specifically ordering the US flag to be flown at full-staff. This proclamation does not contain any provisions related to climate policy or GSA operations.

3. Applicability Analysis:
The executive order (Proclamation 10885) does NOT affect the GSA climate crisis policy. The proclamation is solely about flag-flying protocols and does not introduce any changes to existing environmental or operational policies.

4. Compliance Next Steps:
Since the executive order does not impact the existing climate policy, no immediate action is required. GSA should continue:
- Implementing the existing climate crisis response framework
- Tracking progress toward the net-zero and emissions reduction goals
- Maintaining compliance with the original Executive Order 14057
- Conducting regular reviews and updates to the climate response strategy

Recommendation: Continue current implementation of ADM 1100.1 without modifications based on this executive order.",Not affected,Not Affected,"The executive order regarding flag flying protocols on Inauguration Day has no operational, legal, or procedural impact on GSA's climate crisis policy, as the two documents address entirely unrelated administrative domains.",Not Affected,"## Policy Analysis Summary

### 1. Brief Summary of the Policy Text

GSA Order ADM 1100.1 ""Prioritizing GSA Response to the Climate Crisis"" (effective January 25, 2023 - January 25, 2030) establishes an implementation framework for GSA's climate response activities. The policy aims to achieve ""net zero"" operational and procurement-related carbon emissions and adapt GSA facilities, operations, and supply chains to climate conditions. It references Executive Order 14057 and outlines specific federal sustainability goals including 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030, 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035, net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045, and 65% reduction in scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

### 2. Brief Summary of the Executive Order Text

Proclamation 10885 of January 20, 2025, titled ""Flying the Flag of the United States at Full-Staff on Inauguration Day"" is a ceremonial directive that orders the American flag to be flown at full-staff on all current and future Inauguration Days. The proclamation applies to the White House, public buildings, military installations, naval vessels, and U.S. facilities abroad. It also provides specific instructions for returning to half-staff after Inauguration Day to honor former President Carter's passing.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability

This executive order does **not** apply to the GSA climate policy. The executive order is purely ceremonial in nature, addressing flag protocol for a specific day (Inauguration Day) and memorial observances. It contains no provisions that would:

- Modify federal climate goals or sustainability requirements
- Change GSA's operational mandates regarding carbon emissions
- Alter building portfolio management requirements
- Impact procurement or supply chain climate considerations
- Revoke or supersede existing environmental executive orders

The two documents address entirely different subject matters - one focuses on comprehensive climate action and federal sustainability, while the other establishes flag display protocol for ceremonial purposes.

### 4. Next Steps for Compliance

No compliance actions are required regarding GSA Order ADM 1100.1, as the executive order does not affect the climate policy. GSA should continue implementing the existing climate framework as outlined in the current policy, maintaining adherence to the referenced Executive Order 14057 and associated sustainability goals.

**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",Not Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: Environmental sustainability and climate crisis response, specifically GSA's operational decarbonization and climate adaptation efforts.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Ceremonial protocols for flag display on federal property during Inauguration Day.

3. **Impact Analysis**: No direct or indirect impact exists. The executive order's flag display requirements do not alter, constrain, or influence any aspect of GSA's climate response activities, carbon emission reduction targets, facility adaptations, or supply chain modifications outlined in the policy.

4. **Supporting Language**: The policy focuses on ""net zero operational and procurement-related carbon emissions"" and climate adaptation, while the order simply mandates ""the flag of the United States shall be flo","**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**
The policy ""1100.1ADM, Prioritizing GSA Response to the Climate Crisis"" operates in the domain of environmental sustainability and climate action. It specifically focuses on GSA's implementation framework for achieving net-zero operational and procurement-related carbon emissions and adapting facilities/operations to climate conditions, referencing Executive Order 14057 on federal sustainability.

**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**
The executive order ""Flying The Flag Of The United States At Full-Staff On Inauguration Day"" (Proclamation 10885) operates in the domain of ceremonial protocols and symbolic government practices. It mandates that the U.S. flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day at all federal buildings, military installations, and naval vessels.

**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**
These domains are fundamentally distinct with no meaningful intersection:
- The policy addresses substantive environmental and operational matters
- The executive order addresses ceremonial flag display protocols
- There is no direct operational, regulatory, or procedural connection between climate response activities and flag display requirements

**Step 4: Independent Assessment**
While both involve federal facilities and operations, the executive order's ceremonial nature creates no impact on the policy's climate-focused objectives, implementation mechanisms, or operational requirements.

**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: Environmental sustainability and climate crisis response, specifically GSA's operational decarbonization and climate adaptation efforts.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: Ceremonial protocols for flag display on federal property during Inauguration Day.

3. **Impact Analysis**: No direct or indirect impact exists. The executive order's flag display requirements do not alter, constrain, or influence any aspect of GSA's climate response activities, carbon emission reduction targets, facility adaptations, or supply chain modifications outlined in the policy.

4. **Supporting Language**: The policy focuses on ""net zero operational and procurement-related carbon emissions"" and climate adaptation, while the order simply mandates ""the flag of the United States shall be flown at full-staff"" on Inauguration Day. These provisions operate in entirely separate spheres.

5. **Edge Cases Considered**: Even though both involve federal facilities management, the ceremonial nature of flag display has no bearing on substantive climate policy implementation or environmental objectives.

The phase1_flag assessment of ""Not Affected"" is correct and should be maintained."

LEE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OFFICE OF POLICY AND COMPLIANCE (QV) SUBJECT: Resolving Interagency Policy Differences 1. Purpose. This memorandum defines the consultation process and documentation requirements when resolving interagency policy differences where the Contracting Officer (CO) uses the requesting agency s less restrictive policy. 2. Applicability. This memorandum applies to all FAS activities awarding contracts, Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), or orders via an interagency acquisition. FAR Subpart 2.101 Definitions: Interagency acquisition means a procedure by which an agency needing supplies or services (the requesting agency) obtains them from another agency (the servicing agency) by an assisted acquisition or a direct acquisition. 3. Background. The General Services Administration Manual (GSAM) Subpart 517.5 Interagency Acquisitions clarifies interagency policy differences for interagency acquisitions. The GSAM provides additional guidance on the process of resolving policy differences between GSA and the requesting agency under GSAM Section 517.502(e). 4. Instructions/Procedures. The CO must document their decision process and consult with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) and the FAS Office of Policy and Compliance (OPC), Acquisition Management Division (QVC) (i.e. Service-level acquisition management) when the interagency agreement is unclear on how to resolve interagency policy differences between the requesting agency and GSA. a. For all interagency acquisitions where the CO elects to follow the requesting agency s less restrictive policy (e.g., higher dollar authority, streamlined procedures); the CO must prepare a  Memorandum for Record  similar to Attachment A. b. The memo must include the:   proposed requesting agency s less restrictive policy and the source of the policy (e.g., statute, regulation, internal agency guidance), 1 DocuSign Envelope ID: 5FBCC267-B3F3-47B7-87EE-84A5C8E1E3F6   OGC confirmation that GSA has the authority to utilize the less restrictive policy, and   the management controls the CO will use to manage the Government s risk. c. For FAS OPC/QVC consultation requests; the CO must submit the completed Memorandum for Record with evidence of OGC consultation to: documentreview-fasqv@gsa.gov. When the FAS OPC consultation is complete and the Memorandum of Record is approved, the FAS OPC/QVC Director will return it to the CO. d. At a minimum, the memo should include the following signatures/approvals:   CO   One level above the CO   OGC (e.g. Assistant Regional Counsel)   FAS OPC/QVC Director e. After the memo is approved, it should be filed in Tab 3 (Acquisition Strategy) or Tab 28 (Required Approval/Clearance) of the electronic contract file, according to the FAS Contract File Standards PAP 2020-04. f. As applicable, an Acquisition Review Briefing (ARB) may be required in accordance with GSAM Section 504.7104. NOTE: Attention should be given to the source of each agency s policy. Statutes (including National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA)) and regulations (including the FAR, DFARS and GSAR) carry higher authority than such instruments as a GSA Acquisition Letter (AL), a FAS Procurement Information Notice (PIN), or a DoD Procedures, Guidance and Information (PGI). A CO may not choose the client s less restrictive policy to deviate from a provision in the FAR or GSAR. 5. Effective Date.

Background. Lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American interests should not have access to our Nation s secrets, nor should their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts. My Administration must also take appropriate and nec- essary measures to guard against the actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that arise when the Government funds, engages with, or otherwise devotes resources to law firms and their clients that engage in conduct undermining critical American interests and priorities. I have determined that action is necessary to address the significant risks, egregious conduct, and conflicts of interest associated with Susman Godfrey LLP (Susman). Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections. Susman also funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military through the injection of political and radical ideology, and it supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race. Susman itself engages in unlawful discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race. For example, Susman administers a program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities only to  students of color.  My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimi- nation perpetrated in the name of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec. 2. Security Clearance Review. (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applica- ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Susman, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Susman. The heads of agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec. 3. Contracting. (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Susman and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with Susman or with entities that disclose doing business with Susman under subsection (a) of this section.

Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Susman or with entities that do business with Susman effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. Sec. 4. Racial Discrimination. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP). Sec. 5. Personnel. (a) The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Susman when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Susman employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States. (b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Susman, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

1. Policy Document Summary:
The policy memorandum, issued on January 9, 2023, by Mark J. Lee from the FAS Office of Policy and Compliance, provides guidance for Contracting Officers (COs) on resolving interagency policy differences. It outlines a detailed consultation and documentation process when a CO wants to use a requesting agency's less restrictive policy during interagency acquisitions.

2. Executive Order Summary:
The Executive Order, dated April 9, 2025, specifically targets Susman Godfrey LLP, alleging the law firm engages in activities detrimental to American interests. The order mandates:
- Suspension of security clearances
- Review and potential termination of government contracts
- Limitations on government interactions with the firm
- Restrictions on hiring Susman employees

3. Applicability Analysis:
This executive order does NOT directly impact the interagency acquisition policy. The policy document provides general procedural guidance for resolving policy differences between agencies, and does not specifically involve Susman Godfrey LLP.

The executive order is narrowly focused on one specific law firm and does not fundamentally alter the interagency acquisition consultation process outlined in the GSA policy.

4. Compliance Recommendations:
While no immediate action is required for this specific policy document, GSA acquisition personnel should:
- Be aware of the executive order's broader implications for contractor interactions
- Ensure any future interagency acquisitions include thorough vetting of potential contractors
- Continue following the existing consultation process for resolving policy differences
- Monitor for any additional guidance from GSA leadership regarding contractor engagement

### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text
The GSA FAS memorandum from January 9, 2023, establishes procedures for resolving interagency policy differences in acquisition activities. It requires Contracting Officers (COs) to document their decision-making process and consult with the Office of General Counsel and FAS Office of Policy and Compliance when choosing to follow a requesting agency's less restrictive policy over GSA's standard procedures. The policy applies to all FAS activities awarding contracts, Blanket Purchase Agreements, or orders through interagency acquisitions.

### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text
Executive Order 14263, dated April 9, 2025, targets Susman Godfrey LLP specifically, prohibiting federal agencies from providing taxpayer funds, contracts, or access to classified information to this law firm. The order cites concerns about the firm's activities allegedly undermining American interests, including efforts to ""weaponize the American legal system,"" degrade election quality, undermine military effectiveness through political ideology, and engage in what the order characterizes as unlawful racial discrimination through diversity programs.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability
This executive order **directly affects** the GSA policy. Here's why:

- **Scope Intersection**: The GSA policy governs interagency acquisitions, including contracts and agreements, while the executive order prohibits federal contracting with Susman Godfrey LLP.

- **Implementation Mechanism**: When GSA serves as the servicing agency in interagency acquisitions, the consultation and documentation procedures outlined in the policy would need to account for the executive order's prohibitions.

- **Policy Conflict Resolution**: The existing policy's framework for resolving interagency differences must now incorporate the executive order's blanket prohibition, regardless of whether a requesting agency has less restrictive policies regarding Susman Godfrey.

- **Documentation Requirements**: The ""Memorandum for Record"" requirement would need modification to include verification that proposed contractors are not Susman Godfrey LLP or its affiliates.

### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Update Documentation Templates**: Revise Attachment A (Memorandum for Record template) to include a mandatory section verifying that the proposed contractor is not Susman Godfrey LLP.

2. **Amend Consultation Procedures**: Modify the consultation process with OGC and OPC to include screening for Executive Order 14263 compliance during policy difference resolution.

3. **Training and Communication**: Issue guidance to all FAS COs explaining that Executive Order 14263 supersedes any requesting agency's less restrictive policies regarding Susman Godfrey LLP.

**Policy Updates Required:**
1. Add a new subsection addressing executive order compliance in interagency acquisitions
2. Update the background section to reference Executive Order 14263
3. Include mandatory screening procedures for prohibited entities
4. Establish clear escalation procedures when requesting agencies propose using prohibited contractors

**Ongoing Compliance:**
1. Establish monitoring procedures to ensure continued compliance
2. Regular updates to prohibited entity lists as new executive orders or regulations emerge
3. Coordination with GSA's suspension and debarment officials

**Final Determination: [Affected]**",Affected,"**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal acquisition procedures for interagency acquisitions, specifically addressing policy conflict resolution between requesting and servicing agencies.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: National security restrictions on federal contracting with law firms deemed detrimental to American interests, including prohibition on federal funding and contracts.

3. **Direct Impact Analysis**: The executive order creates new substantive restrictions that must be incorporated into all federal contracting processes, including interagency acquisitions. When FAS conducts interagency acquisitions covered by this memorandum, they would now need to ensure compliance with EO 14263's restrictions on contracting with specified law firms.

4. **Key Supporting Language**: 
   - EO 14263","**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**
The FAS Memorandum addresses interagency acquisitions and procurement procedures, specifically focusing on resolving policy differences between agencies when conducting interagency contracts, Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), and orders. This is a federal acquisition and procurement policy document.

**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**
Executive Order 14263 addresses national security risks related to law firms (specifically mentioning Susman Godfrey) that engage in activities ""detrimental to critical American interests."" The order focuses on preventing such entities from accessing national secrets and being subsidized by federal taxpayer funds or contracts, while addressing conflicts of interest.

**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**
Both documents operate in the federal contracting and acquisition space, but from different angles:
- The policy addresses procedural aspects of interagency acquisitions
- The executive order addresses substantive restrictions on who can receive federal contracts based on national security considerations

There is a clear intersection where the executive order's restrictions on federal contracting would need to be implemented through existing procurement processes, including interagency acquisitions covered by the FAS memorandum.

**Step 4: Independent Assessment**
While the initial flag was ""Affected,"" I need to evaluate whether EO 14263's restrictions on contracting with certain law firms would actually impact the interagency acquisition procedures outlined in the FAS memorandum.

**Final Decision: [Affected]**

**Full Justification:**

1. **Policy Domain**: Federal acquisition procedures for interagency acquisitions, specifically addressing policy conflict resolution between requesting and servicing agencies.

2. **Executive Order Domain**: National security restrictions on federal contracting with law firms deemed detrimental to American interests, including prohibition on federal funding and contracts.

3. **Direct Impact Analysis**: The executive order creates new substantive restrictions that must be incorporated into all federal contracting processes, including interagency acquisitions. When FAS conducts interagency acquisitions covered by this memorandum, they would now need to ensure compliance with EO 14263's restrictions on contracting with specified law firms.

4. **Key Supporting Language**: 
   - EO 14263 states law firms engaging in detrimental activities ""should not...have their conduct subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts""
   - The policy covers ""all FAS activities awarding contracts, Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), or orders via an interagency acquisition""
   - The intersection occurs where interagency acquisition procedures must now incorporate new eligibility restrictions

5. **Nuances Considered**: While the policy is procedural and the order is substantive, federal acquisition procedures must incorporate all applicable legal restrictions. The memorandum's process for resolving interagency policy differences would need to account for the non-negotiable restrictions imposed by EO 14263, making the policy affected by the executive order's requirements."

Funding under this program was provided for the U.S. Courthouses in Hartford, CT, Fort Lauderdale, FL, Chattanooga, TN, the DHS Consolidation at St. Elizabeths, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Lease Purchase Option, the Southeast Federal Center Remediation, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters Consolidation. Regarding the U.S. Courthouses: - Since Hartford and Chattanooga were partially funded in FY 2021 and FY 2022, prospectuses in support of these projects were transmitted to GSA s Authorizing Committees, and we have received both House and Senate approvals. - Considering Fort Lauderdale previously received FY 2018 appropriations, both House and Senate FY 2018 prospectus approvals, and original scope has not changed, GSA may proceed awarding the additional FY 2023 funding to address cost escalation due to time and market conditions associated with the FY 2018 prospectus scope. FY 2023 Capital Investment Program Status Update and Execution Guidance Page 2 DocuSign Envelope ID: B9DBD55F-BB2F-499B-89B5-A6FB6F03BEE1 NOTE: In FY 2023, Congress increased our internal BA51 escalation prospectus authority from 10% up to 20%. Increasing our escalation authority affords GSA more internal flexibility to cover cost increases for these BA51 projects without first obtaining external OMB and Congressional approval. This 20% increased threshold applies only to the new construction and remediation project funding listed in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. All previous New Construction funding is still subject to the previous 10% internal escalation threshold. Major Repairs and Alterations Program Appropriations The $662,280,000 appropriated for Major Repairs and Alterations (Major R&A) was $1,089,590,000 less than the requested amount of $1,751,870,000. Unlike previous years, the Act provided specific line item appropriations for each of our Major R&A Programs. - The Basic Repairs and Alterations (BA54) program was appropriated at our full requested amount of $398,797,000. - The $244,783,000 appropriated for Major R&A (BA55) projects was $943,290,000 less than the requested amount of $1,188,073,000. - The $18,700,000 appropriated for Special Emphasis (BA55) programs was $146,300,000 less than the requested amount of $165,000,000.

Increasing our escalation authority affords GSA more internal flexibility to cover cost increases for BA55 projects without first obtaining external OMB and Congressional approval. Furthermore, since the Act s provision specifically states ""funds made available in this or any previous Act...."", the 20% increased threshold also applies to previous years BA55 prospectus projects and funding.

Policy. American citizens deserve an excellent and efficient Federal workforce that attracts the highest caliber of civil servants committed to achieving the freedom, prosperity, and democratic rule that our Constitution promotes. But current Federal hiring practices are broken, insular, and out- dated. They no longer focus on merit, practical skill, and dedication to our Constitution. Federal hiring should not be based on impermissible factors, such as one s commitment to illegal racial discrimination under the guise of  equity,  or one s commitment to the invented concept of  gender iden- tity  over sex. Inserting such factors into the hiring process subverts the will of the People, puts critical government functions at risk, and risks losing the best-qualified candidates. By making our recruitment and hiring processes more efficient and focused on serving the Nation, we will ensure that the Federal workforce is prepared to help achieve American greatness, and attracts the talent necessary to serve our citizens effectively. By significantly improving hiring principles and practices, Americans will receive the Federal resources and services they deserve from the highest-skilled Federal workforce in the world. Sec. 2. Federal Hiring Plan. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the Administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), shall develop and send to agency heads a Federal Hiring Plan that brings to the Federal workforce only highly skilled Americans dedicated to the furtherance of American ideals, values, and interests. (b) This Federal Hiring Plan shall: (i) prioritize recruitment of individuals committed to improving the effi- ciency of the Federal government, passionate about the ideals of our American republic, and committed to upholding the rule of law and the United States Constitution; (ii) prevent the hiring of individuals based on their race, sex, or religion, and prevent the hiring of individuals who are unwilling to defend the Constitution or to faithfully serve the Executive Branch; (iii) implement, to the greatest extent possible, technical and alternative assessments as required by the Chance to Compete Act of 2024; (iv) decrease government-wide time-to-hire to under 80 days; (v) improve communication with candidates to provide greater clarity regarding application status, timelines, and feedback, including regular updates on the progress of applications and explanations of hiring decisions where appropriate; (vi) integrate modern technology to support the recruitment and selection process, including the use of data analytics to identify trends, gaps, and VerDate Sep<11>2014 18:45 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\FR\FM\30JAE9.SGM 30JAE9 5 1 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l 8622 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents opportunities in hiring, as well as leveraging digital platforms to improve candidate engagement; and (vii) ensure Department and Agency leadership, or their designees, are active participants in implementing the new processes and throughout the full hiring process.

(d) The Federal Hiring Plan shall provide specific best practices for the human resources function in each agency, which each agency head shall implement, with advice and recommendations as appropriate from DOGE. Sec. 3. Accountability and Reporting. (a) The Director of the Office of Per- sonnel Management shall establish clear performance metrics to evaluate the success of these reforms, and request agency analysis on a regular basis. (b) The Office of Personnel Management shall consult with Federal agen- cies, labor organizations, and other stakeholders to monitor progress and ensure that the reforms are meeting the needs of both candidates and agencies. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals; or (iii) the functions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee relating to its conduct of monetary policy.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this analysis?",Not affected,Affected,"Although the policy and executive order cover different primary domains, the hiring process reforms mandated by EO 14170 will necessitate changes in GSA's talent acquisition and leadership allocation strategies, which could materially impact the implementation of the Capital Investment Program.",Not Affected,"## Policy Analysis: GSA Capital Investment Program vs. Executive Order 14170

### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text
The GSA memorandum dated January 13, 2023, provides guidance on the FY 2023 Capital Investment Program execution. It addresses budget appropriations totaling $1,470,089,000 (reduced from the requested $2,159,893,000), discusses funding allocations for construction and acquisition programs including U.S. Courthouses and DHS facilities, and provides operational guidance for regional directors on project execution and fund management under continuing resolution conditions.

### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text
Executive Order 14170, issued January 20, 2025, focuses on reforming federal hiring processes to restore merit-based selection. It prohibits hiring decisions based on ""impermissible factors"" such as commitments to ""illegal racial discrimination under the guise of equity"" or ""gender identity over sex."" The order mandates development of a Federal Hiring Plan within 120 days and emphasizes recruiting based on merit, practical skills, and constitutional dedication.

### 3. Detailed Analysis of Executive Order Applicability
This executive order does **not apply** to the GSA Capital Investment Program policy for the following reasons:

**Subject Matter Distinction**: The GSA memorandum exclusively addresses capital investment program execution, budget allocations, construction projects, and financial management procedures. It contains no provisions related to federal hiring, recruitment practices, personnel selection criteria, or employment policies.

**Operational Scope**: The policy focuses on:
- Budget execution and fund management
- Construction and acquisition project oversight
- Regional coordination and project delivery
- Appropriation compliance and reporting

The executive order addresses:
- Federal hiring and recruitment processes
- Personnel selection criteria and merit-based evaluation
- Prohibited discrimination factors in employment decisions

**No Intersection**: There is no overlap between the capital investment program's operational guidance and the hiring reform mandates of the executive order. The policy does not establish, modify, or reference any hiring practices or personnel selection procedures.

### 4. Next Steps for Compliance
No compliance actions are required because the executive order does not apply to this policy. The GSA Capital Investment Program can continue operating under the existing January 2023 guidance without modification.

However, GSA should separately ensure that any hiring activities within the capital investment program (such as recruiting contractors or federal personnel for project management roles) comply with the new executive order requirements through appropriate HR channels.

**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",Not Affected,"1. **Policy Subject Area**: Federal capital investment program execution, specifically GSA's FY 2023 budget allocation and project funding procedures for real estate and construction activities.

2. **Executive Order Subject Area**: Federal hiring reform, merit-based personnel selection, and elimination of certain diversity considerations in employment practices.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact between these domains. The policy addresses purely financial and budgetary execution procedures for capital projects, while the EO addresses human resources and hiring practices. The policy contains no provisions related to personnel decisions, hiring criteria, or employment practices that would be affected by the hiring reform mandate.

4. **Supporting Language**: The","## Step 1: Policy Domain Analysis
The policy is a GSA Capital Investment Program Execution Memorandum focused on **federal real estate and construction management**. It addresses budget execution, funding allocations, escalation authority, and capital investment programming for federal facilities and infrastructure projects.

## Step 2: Executive Order Domain Analysis
Executive Order 14170 focuses on **federal human resources and personnel management**. It targets hiring practices, merit-based selection, civil service reform, and elimination of certain diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations in federal employment decisions.

## Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment
These represent fundamentally different operational domains:
- **Policy Domain**: Capital investment, budget execution, facilities management, construction oversight
- **EO Domain**: Personnel hiring, merit systems, civil service practices, employment procedures

While both involve federal government operations, they address entirely separate functional areas with no operational overlap.

## Step 4: Independent Assessment
Despite the initial ""Not Affected"" flag, I conducted an independent analysis examining potential indirect connections such as:
- Workforce implications for GSA construction/facilities staff
- Contracting personnel involved in capital projects  
- Administrative processes that might intersect

However, this policy is purely focused on budget execution mechanics and funding procedures, with no personnel hiring or employment components.

## Final Decision: [Not Affected]

## Full Justification:

1. **Policy Subject Area**: Federal capital investment program execution, specifically GSA's FY 2023 budget allocation and project funding procedures for real estate and construction activities.

2. **Executive Order Subject Area**: Federal hiring reform, merit-based personnel selection, and elimination of certain diversity considerations in employment practices.

3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact between these domains. The policy addresses purely financial and budgetary execution procedures for capital projects, while the EO addresses human resources and hiring practices. The policy contains no provisions related to personnel decisions, hiring criteria, or employment practices that would be affected by the hiring reform mandate.

4. **Supporting Language**: The policy text focuses exclusively on ""budget execution,"" ""obligational authority,"" ""capital investment,"" and ""funding allocations"" - all financial/budgetary terms. The EO addresses ""hiring processes,"" ""merit,"" ""civil servants,"" and ""employment practices"" - all personnel-related terms with no intersection.

5. **Edge Cases Considered**: Even considering indirect effects such as potential impacts on GSA hiring for positions that manage these capital programs, the policy itself remains unaffected as it deals with existing budget execution procedures rather than staffing decisions or hiring practices.

The domains are sufficiently distinct with no meaningful intersection that would require policy modification or implementation changes."
