Purpose The purpose of this Procurement Instructional Bulletin (PIB) is to outline the guidelines for implementation and use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool. 2. Background The Skill Enhancement & Employee Development (SEED) program was created to provide the 1102 contract specialist community with a solid foundation, minimize acquisition skill gaps, and increase the overall knowledge and skills of the acquisition workforce. As part of SEED, the PATH tool was developed to give those in the 1102 acquisition community with little to no contracting knowledge a tool to learn and test their knowledge using scenario based exercises. The tool consists of various exercises categorized into the following modules: Pre-Award, Award, Post-Award, and Other. 3. Effective Date This PIB is effective on the date signed. The exercises that make up the training tool will be updated, as needed, to address any regulatory changes or Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) policy guidance 1800 F Street, NW Washington, DC 20405-0002 www.gsa.gov DocuSign Envelope ID: 3DF787F3-F9CB-4240-B6F6-E46C4D13456610/28/2022 revisions. 4. Cancellation Date This PIB will remain in effect until canceled. 5. Affected or Canceled Policies None. 6. Applicability This PIB applies to all Public Buildings Service (PBS) 1102s, including interns hired under the PBS Acquisition Intern Program. Use of the PATH tool is mandatory for new employees at the GS-09 level and below who are hired on or after the effective date of this tool. The tool is optional for those employees above the GS-09 level. 7. Exceptions The requirements of this PIB will not be applicable to employees who are participating under the Emerging Leaders Program (ELP), until they are converted to the 1102 series. 8. Instructions and Procedures Exercises & Answer Keys The exercises are broken into four modules: Pre-award, Award, Post-Award, and Other. There are two documents for each topic: the exercise and answer key. Links to all of the documents can be found on Attachment 1 - PATH Tool Table of Contents. Users should complete the exercises in chronological order. Some exercises have a service and construction type scenario. In those cases, users can elect to complete one or both exercises. The users will access the exercise, read the scenario, if one is included, and use the policy and guidance references to answer the questions. Only the regional supervisors will have access to the answer key documents. Upon completion of each exercise, users must work with their supervisor, or designee, to review their responses and compare them to the answer key. This will help ensure that users understand the general concepts of the exercise topic. 2 DocuSign Envelope ID: 3DF787F3-F9CB-4240-B6F6-E46C4D134566 New employees will be expected to complete the entire tool within 18 months of their start date. At a minimum, the first module (Pre-Award) is to be completed within the first year. FAI CSOD & CLPs Upon completion of all exercises in a module, users are to ensure that their completion is indicated in FAI Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD). To do this, supervisors are to complete the survey form linked as Attachment 2 - PATH Tool Supervisor Confirmation of Completion. Upon receipt, OAM will update FAI CSOD. This must be done for completion of each module. OAM will use this information to track completion of the tool. This process will also assist to provide continuous learning points (CLPs) to users who are eligible to receive them. 9.

Purpose. Federal regulations should not predetermine economic winners and losers. Yet some regulations operate to exclude new market entrants. Regulations that reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innova- tion as well as the benefits they create for American consumers should be eliminated. This order commences the process for eliminating anti-com- petitive regulations to revitalize the American economy. Sec. 2. Definitions. (a)  Agency  has the meaning given to it in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code, except that it does not include the Executive Office of the President or any components thereof. (b)  Agency head  means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director, unless otherwise specified in this order. Sec. 3. Rescinding Anti-Competitive Regulations. (a) Agency heads shall, in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (Chair- man) and the Attorney General, complete a review of all regulations subject to their rulemaking authority and identify those that: (i) create, or facilitate the creation of, de facto or de jure monopolies; (ii) create unnecessary barriers to entry for new market participants; (iii) limit competition between competing entities or have the effect of limiting competition between competing entities; (iv) create or facilitate licensure or accreditation requirements that unduly limit competition; (v) unnecessarily burden the agency s procurement processes, thereby lim- iting companies  ability to compete for procurements; or (vi) otherwise impose anti-competitive restraints or distortions on the oper- ation of the free market. (b) Within 70 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall each provide to the Chairman and the Attorney General a list of regulations identified by the categories specified in subsection (a) of this section. Agency heads shall also include a recommendation as to whether each of the listed regulations warrants rescission or modification in light of its anti-competitive effects. For recommended modifications, agency heads shall briefly specify what modification is appropriate. For regulations that are anti-competitive by design, agency heads shall provide a justification for their anti-competitive effects if the agency head is not proposing rescission or modification. (c) In conducting the review required by subsection (a) of this section, agency heads shall prioritize review of those rules that satisfy the definition of  significant regulatory action  in Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended. (d) Within 10 days of the date of this order, the Chairman shall issue a request for information (RFI) that seeks public input on the identification of regulations that fall within the categories specified in subsection (a) of this section, as well as comments explaining the proposed classifications. The request shall remain open for 40 days.

      "Summary": "Policy Analysis Summary\n\n1. Policy Summary (GSA Public Buildings Service PBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 23-01):\nThe policy outlines the mandatory use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool for Public Buildings Service (PBS) contract specialists. Specifically, it requires:\n- Mandatory training for new employees at GS-09 level and below\n- Completion of training modules within 18 months of start date\n- Tracking of completion through FAI Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD)\n- Focus on skill enhancement for the 1102 contract specialist community\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nThe executive order aims to reduce anti-competitive regulatory barriers by:\n- Requiring agencies to review and identify regulations that:\n  a) Create monopolies\n  b) Create barriers to market entry\n  c) Limit competition\n  d) Impose unnecessary regulatory constraints\n- Mandating a comprehensive review of existing regulations\n- Seeking public input on potentially anti-competitive regulations\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nAfter careful review, this specific policy does NOT appear to be directly impacted by the executive order for the following reasons:\n- The PATH tool is an internal training mechanism\n- It does not create market barriers or limit competition\n- The policy is focused on employee skill development\n- The training program does not regulate market access or business operations\n\n4. Recommended Next Steps:\nWhile immediate action is not required, GSA should:\n- Retain the current policy as is\n- During the next policy review, document how the PATH tool supports, rather than limits, competitive acquisition practices\n- Be prepared to provide documentation if requested during the executive order's regulatory review process\n- Ensure transparency in the training program's objectives and implementation\n\nCaveat: This analysis is based on the available documents and represents a preliminary assessment. Formal legal review is recommended for definitive guidance.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this analysis?",

      "phase1_response": "As a policy analyst for the General Services Administration (GSA), I have reviewed the provided documents to determine if Procurement Instructional Bulletin (PIB) 23-01 is affected by Executive Order 14267.\n\nHere is a summary of my findings:\n\n### 1. Summary of the Policy Text (GSA PIB 23-01)\nThe policy, GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) Procurement Instructional Bulletin 23-01, establishes the mandatory use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool for certain employees. The PATH tool is an internal training program designed to build foundational knowledge for new contract specialists (1102 series) at the GS-09 level and below. It provides scenario-based exercises across Pre-Award, Award, and Post-Award procurement phases. The policy outlines the procedures for completing the training, supervisor involvement in reviewing answers, and the process for tracking completion to award Continuous Learning Points (CLPs). This is an internal workforce development and training policy.\n\n### 2. Summary of the Executive Order Text (EO 14267)\nExecutive Order 14267, \"Reducing Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers,\" directs federal agencies to review their regulations and identify any that create unnecessary barriers to economic competition. The stated purpose is to eliminate regulations that hinder new market entrants, limit competition, or otherwise distort the free market. The order specifically instructs agency heads to identify rules that, among other things, create monopolies, establish unnecessary barriers to entry for companies, or \"unnecessarily burden the agency's procurement processes, thereby limiting companies' ability to compete for procurements.\"\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\nThis Executive Order **does not apply** to GSA PIB 23-01. The core distinction lies in the nature and scope of the two documents.\n\n*   **Target of the Executive Order:** The EO is focused on external-facing **regulations** that impact the public and private sectors, specifically those that govern market dynamics and competition. Its aim is to identify and remove rules that negatively affect companies, entrepreneurs, and the economy. Section 3(a)(v) targets rules that burden the procurement process for outside companies seeking to do business with the government.\n*   **Nature of the Policy Document:** The PIB is an **internal policy bulletin**, not an external regulation. Its purpose is to manage the professional development and training of GSA's own employees. It dictates how GSA trains its acquisition workforce; it does not impose any requirements, burdens, or conditions on external entities (e.g., contractors, vendors, or potential bidders).\n\nWhile the PIB relates to the acquisition workforce, it does not \"unnecessarily burden the agency's procurement processes\" in the manner contemplated by the Executive Order. In fact, the policy's goal is to improve the skills of the acquisition workforce, which should lead to a more efficient, knowledgeable, and consistently run procurement process. A well-trained workforce is less likely to create undue burdens on industry. The PATH tool is an internal training mechanism, not a barrier to market entry or a limitation on corporate competition for government contracts.\n\nTherefore, the PIB falls outside the scope of the regulatory review mandated by EO 14267.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\nBecause the policy is not affected by the Executive Order, no direct action is required for PIB 23-01.\n\n*   No modification or rescission of PIB 23-01 is necessary as a result of EO 14267.\n*   This policy bulletin does not need to be included in the list of regulations that GSA provides to the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General under Section 3(b) of the EO.\n*   GSA should proceed with the agency-wide review of its external-facing regulations as mandated by the Executive Order, focusing on rules that directly impact market competition and procurement access for outside companies.\n\n***\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

Its specific purpose is to mandate the use of the \"Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH)\" tool for new acquisition employees (1102 contract specialists) at the GS-09 level and below. This policy governs the internal procedures for training government personnel to enhance their procurement skills.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** Executive Order 14267, \"Reducing Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers,\" is an economic and regulatory policy directive. Its goal is to identify and eliminate federal regulations that negatively impact free-market competition. It targets rules that create monopolies, erect barriers to market entry for new companies, and hinder the ability of businesses to compete for government contracts.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** There is no direct or indirect impact of EO 14267 on PIB 23-01. The policy and the executive order operate in entirely separate spheres. The policy is inward-facing, governing the training and development of federal employees. The EO is outward-facing, concerned with the effect of federal regulations on the external marketplace and private sector entities. The training requirements outlined in the PIB do not create any burdens, barriers, or rules that private companies must follow to compete for government procurements.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:**\n    *   **Policy (PIB 23-01):** The key language focuses entirely on internal personnel management: \"The purpose of this Procurement Instructional Bulletin (PIB) is to outline the guidelines for implementation and use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool.\" and \"This PIB applies to all Public Buildings Service (PBS) 1102s, including interns...\" This confirms its scope is limited to GSA employees.\n    *   **Executive Order (EO 14267):** The key provisions target regulations that \"create unnecessary barriers to entry for new market participants,\" \"limit competition between competing entities,\" or \"unnecessarily burden the agency s procurement processes, thereby limiting companies\u2019 ability to compete for procurements.\" The PIB does none of these things; it is a tool to improve the workforce, not a rule that constrains the market.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** One could argue that a better-trained acquisition workforce might lead to more efficient and competitive procurement processes, which is broadly aligned with the spirit of the EO. However, this is a beneficial, second-order outcome and not a direct regulatory impact. The EO is concerned with eliminating regulations that *create* anti-competitive barriers, not assessing internal training policies that may indirectly improve market efficiency. The PIB is an instructional bulletin for internal management, not a \"regulation\" in the sense targeted by the EO, which affects public and private entities.

Governance and Engagement. PBS business lines and regional leaders shall participate in, engage with, and support PBS sustainability governance bodies. Regional Commissioners (or their proxies) shall chair, re-establish, and support Regional Sustainability Councils (RSCs). New or existing cross functional teams should be established across business lines at the implementation, planning, and/or senior level as needed. Challenges should be raised to regional leadership and shared for visibility with the Regional Sustainability Council, the PBS National Sustainability Council (NSC), and, as appropriate, the PBS Sustainability Governance Board (SGB). b. Strategy. PBS business lines and regions will be held accountable for developing and complying with all current and forthcoming strategies, initiatives, actions, and measures to ensure goals of this Order are met. All business lines and divisions shall utilize sustainability status and building-level performance data for energy, water, waste, and GHG to set goals, milestones, and strategic plans. Performance data tools include but are not limited to: GHG Tracking Tools, National Computerized Maintenance Management System, Federal Real Property Profile, Smart Location Tool, and Energy Use and Analysis System. DocuSign Envelope ID: EB036CCD-245A-4ADA-A165-0DD7427071E2 PBS 1098.1 c. Sustainability Plans. PBS Regional Commissioners must establish a sustainability implementation plan (SIP) for their respective regions within 120 days of the date of this Order and update it annually thereafter. These regional SIPs will be reviewed by a subteam of the PBS NSC. Regional SIPs will be incorporated into the GSA Sustainability Strategic Plan and GSA Sustainability Report that will require concurrence by the PBS SGB. PBS Central Office will provide a regional SIP template. Plans must, at a minimum, cover roles and responsibilities, stakeholder engagement, and measures/metrics. GSA Sustainability Strategic Plan and Regional SIPs must make use of facility-level performance data for energy, water, and greenhouse gases. As the regional SIPs are developed and reviewed, best practices will be shared on the Climate & Sustainability Division s Insite page. Each region will provide quarterly quantitative and qualitative updates on progress toward its goals, including any challenges, to the NSC and, as appropriate, SGB. The PBS Climate and Sustainability Officer is responsible for coordinating these activities with the PBS Commissioner, Senior Leadership Team, SGB, NSC, Electric Vehicle PMO, and other business line staff as appropriate and communicating ongoing progress toward sustainability goals. d.

      "Summary": "Here's a comprehensive policy analysis:\n\n1. Policy Summary:\nThe GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) Sustainability Performance Order (PBS 1098.1) provides comprehensive guidelines for achieving sustainability across federal real estate. Key goals include:\n- Reducing energy, water, and waste usage\n- Decreasing greenhouse gas emissions\n- Achieving net zero operational emissions by 2045\n- Improving building performance and environmental stewardship\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nThe executive order is a Presidential Proclamation regarding flag protocols on Inauguration Day, specifically mandating full-staff flag display on Inauguration Day and returning to half-staff afterward in remembrance of a former president.\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order does NOT impact the PBS Sustainability Performance policy. The proclamation is solely about flag display protocols and does not:\n- Modify sustainability regulations\n- Change environmental performance standards\n- Alter GSA's sustainability objectives\n- Impact building management or emissions reduction goals\n\n4. Compliance Next Steps:\nNo specific compliance actions are required, as the executive order is unrelated to the sustainability policy. The PBS Sustainability Performance Order remains fully in effect and should continue implementation as originally outlined.\n\nRecommendation: Continue executing the sustainability policy according to its existing guidelines and timelines. No modifications are necessary based on this executive order.",

      "phase1_response": "**MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD**\n\n**FROM:** GSA Policy Analyst\n**DATE:** October 26, 2023\n**SUBJECT:** Analysis of the Impact of Proclamation 10885 on GSA Order PBS 1098.1 (Sustainability Performance)\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of whether Proclamation 10885 affects the implementation or substance of GSA Order PBS 1098.1.\n\n### 1. Summary of Policy Text (GSA Order PBS 1098.1)\nGSA Order PBS 1098.1, titled \"Sustainability Performance,\" is a comprehensive internal directive for the Public Buildings Service (PBS). It outlines GSA's commitment to improving sustainability across its portfolio of owned and leased federal buildings. The policy's overarching goals are to reduce energy use, water consumption, waste, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a target of achieving portfolio-wide net-zero operational emissions by 2045. The Order establishes specific responsibilities and actions for various PBS business lines, including Acquisition, Design and Construction, Facilities Management, Leasing, and Portfolio Management, to ensure these sustainability goals are integrated into all aspects of federal real estate management.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text (Proclamation 10885)\nProclamation 10885 is a presidential directive concerning the proper display of the flag of the United States on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025. It orders that the flag be flown at full-staff on all public buildings, military installations, and U.S. facilities for the duration of that day. The proclamation was issued to honor Inauguration Day and temporarily supersedes a previous order that had directed flags to be flown at half-staff in memory of former President James Earl Carter, Jr. The order is specific, time-bound, and pertains exclusively to flag etiquette.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\nThe executive order (Proclamation 10885) **does not apply to or affect** GSA Order PBS 1098.1.\n\nThe two documents govern entirely separate and non-overlapping domains.\n\n*   **Subject Matter:** GSA Order PBS 1098.1 is a detailed, technical, and long-term policy focused on building performance, energy efficiency, sustainable procurement, and environmental stewardship. Its provisions relate to HVAC systems, building materials, energy contracts, and operational procedures. In contrast, Proclamation 10885 is a ceremonial directive concerning the symbolic display of the national flag.\n*   **Scope of Directives:** The GSA Order directs internal business practices related to sustainability. The Proclamation directs a specific action (raising a flag) on a specific day.\n*   **Lack of Conflict:** There is no conflict or interaction between the requirements of the two documents. Fulfilling the directive to fly the U.S. flag at full-staff has no bearing on the GSA's ability to reduce GHG emissions, procure carbon-free electricity, or implement sustainable design principles. Similarly, the sustainability policy does not contain any provisions related to flag display protocol.\n\nWhile both documents apply to \"public buildings,\" they address completely different aspects of those buildings' management and operation. One concerns the physical and environmental performance of the asset, while the other concerns a ceremonial protocol.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\nAs the executive order does not affect the policy, no actions are required to bring GSA Order PBS 1098.1 into compliance. PBS business lines should continue to focus on implementing the sustainability goals, plans, and responsibilities as outlined in GSA Order PBS 1098.1 without modification.\n\n***\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",

      "phase2_justification": "1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy**: The policy, GSA Order PBS 1098.1, \"Sustainability Performance,\" establishes a comprehensive framework for the Public Buildings Service (PBS) to improve the environmental and sustainability performance of its real property portfolio. Its domain is squarely focused on technical and operational aspects of building management, including reducing energy and water consumption, lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, achieving net-zero operational emissions, utilizing sustainable materials, and implementing sustainable design, construction, and leasing practices.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order**: Presidential Proclamation 10885, \"Flying the Flag of the United States at Full-Staff on Inauguration Day,\" has a very narrow and specific domain: ceremonial flag protocol. Its sole purpose is to mandate that the U.S. flag be flown at full-staff on all federal buildings and facilities on Inauguration Day.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact**: There is no direct or indirect impact from Proclamation 10885 on GSA Order PBS 1098.1. The subject matters of the two documents are entirely unrelated.\n    *   **No Direct Impact**: The proclamation does not alter, amend, supersede, or conflict with any of the goals, responsibilities, or procedures outlined in the sustainability policy. The requirements for building electrification, energy use intensity targets, sustainable procurement, or developing regional sustainability plans are completely unaffected by the protocol for displaying a flag.\n    *   **No Indirect Impact**: The act of flying a flag at full-staff has no bearing on a building's energy consumption, water usage, waste generation, or GHG emissions. Compliance with the proclamation is a ceremonial, operational task that exists entirely separate from the long-term, strategic sustainability initiatives mandated by the GSA Order.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination**:\n    *   **Policy Text (PBS 1098.1)** focuses on terms such as \"reduce energy use, water use, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions,\" \"net zero operational emissions,\" \"sustainable materials and products,\" \"life-cycle cost-effective,\" and \"building electrification strategies.\"\n    *   **Order Text (Proclamation 10885)** focuses exclusively on the directive that \"the flag of the United States shall be flown at full-staff... on this and all future Inauguration Days.\"\n    The complete dissimilarity in the language and objectives of the two documents demonstrates their lack of relationship.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment**: While the GSA's Public Buildings Service is responsible for managing the \"public buildings and grounds\" upon which the flag must be flown, this responsibility is a routine operational duty. It does not intersect with the strategic planning, capital investment, procurement, and performance tracking required by the sustainability policy. Adherence to the flag proclamation is a distinct, parallel responsibility that does not influence the implementation or outcomes of GSA Order PBS 1098.1. Therefore, the policy is not affected.",

The relevant enacted language from the Act is as follows:  For an additional amount to be deposited in the  Federal Buildings Fund , $3,418,008,000, to remain available until expended, for construction and acquisition, and repairs and alterations of border stations and land ports of entry, of which no more than $250,000,000 shall be for Program Contingency and Operational Support for necessary expenses for projects funded under this heading, including, moving governmental agencies (including space alterations and adjustments, and telecommunications relocation expenses) in connection with the assignment, allocation and transfer of space, leasing of temporary space, and building operations, of which  (1) $2,527,808,000 shall be for projects on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection five-year plan; (2) $430,200,000 shall be for projects with completed U.S. Customs and Border Protection/General Services Administration feasibility studies as prioritized in the  American Jobs Plan Project List  submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on May 28, 2021; and (3) $210,000,000 shall be for land ports of entry (LPOE) infrastructure paving; acquisition of leased LPOEs; and additional Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration requirements at the Southern Border: Provided, That the General Services Administration shall submit a plan, by project, regarding the use of funds made available to the Administrator under this heading in this Act to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 90 days of enactment of this Act: Provided further, That the Administrator of General Services shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate quarterly on the obligations and expenditures of the funds provided under this heading in this Act by account of the Federal Buildings Fund: Provided further, That funds made available under this heading in this Act for Federal Buildings Fund activities may be transferred to, and merged with, other accounts within the Federal Buildings Fund only to the extent necessary to meet program requirements for such activities: Provided further, That the General Services Administration will provide notice in advance to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate of any proposed transfers: Provided further, That funds made available to the Administrator under this heading in this Act shall not be subject to section 3307 of title 40, United States Code: Provided further, That amounts made available under this heading in this Act shall be in addition to any other amounts made available for such purposes, including for construction and acquisition or repairs and alterations: Provided further, That such amount is designated by the Congress as being 3 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A for an emergency requirement pursuant to section 4112(a) of H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, and to section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.  The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) Office of Budget (BB), Financial Management (BG), and Office of PBS Financial Services (BR), together with the Public Buildings Service (PBS), drafted this guidance document for the management of the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) BIL funds. B. New Accounting Codes 1. Fund 192J Fund 192J has been established in GSA s accounting system, Pegasys, for the use of PBS, and will be used specifically for the obligation of FBF funds appropriated by the BIL. The Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) for fund 192J is the same as the FBF; TAS 47X4542. Please note that the FBF, which is the traditional funding vehicle for PBS, is a no-year quasi-revolving fund and permits PBS to use new obligational authority until expended. As the enacted language states,  For an additional amount to be deposited in the  Federal Buildings Fund , $3,418,008,000, to remain available until expended .. , fund 192J will be structured as a no-year fund in Pegasys . BIL obligations and expenses must not be included in the regular FBF 192X account and reported as such, due to special reporting requirements stipulated for these funds under the Act and apportionment by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Therefore, for ease of reporting, the BIL funding must be tracked and managed separately, using a new fund (fund 192J). For financial reporting, all obligations and outlays will still be reported under the Federal Buildings Fund TAS 47X4542. 2. Budget Activities The BIL appropriated funds in five different spending categories. In order to track and manage each category within the spending plan and apportionment, five budget activities within 192J are created and listed below. These are established for use in fund 192J only, and cannot be used in fund 192X.   PG11 CBP LPOE Five Year Plan Projects: Land Ports of Entry (LPOE) projects on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection five-year plan.   PG12 AJP Priority LPOE Projects: projects with completed U.S. Customs and Border Protection/General Services Administration feasibility studies as prioritized in the  American Jobs Plan Project List  submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on May 28, 2021. 4 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A   PG13 LPOE Paving, Acquisition of Leased LPOE, and FMCSA Projects: for LPOE infrastructure paving; acquisition of leased LPOEs; and additional Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) requirements at the Southern Border.   PG14 Program Contingency: This budget activity will be used for project contingency funds.   Per the public law:  no more than $250,000,000 shall be for Program Contingency and Operational Support for necessary expenses for projects funded under this heading, including, moving governmental agencies (including space alterations and adjustments, and telecommunications relocation expenses) in connection with the assignment allocation and transfer of space, leasing of temporary space, and building operations.    PG15 Operational Support: This budget activity will be used for operational support costs. This funding is capped at $250,000,000 along with the contingency.   Per the public law: no more than $250,000,000 shall be for Program Contingency and Operational Support for necessary expenses for projects funded under this heading, including, moving governmental agencies (including space alterations and adjustments, and telecommunications relocation expenses) in connection with the assignment allocation and transfer of space, leasing of temporary space, and building operations.   At this time, PBS does not plan to issue allowances for operational support from the BIL. Please see section C  Tracking PBS Operating Expenses Related to BIL . All current budget activities in fund 192X will continue to be used only for FBF activities as appropriated, and will not be available under fund 192J. Regular 192X and BIL 192J funding can be used in conjunction with each other on LPOE projects. These situations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in coordination with OCFO, PBS Portfolio, Office of the General Counsel, and the LPOE Program Management Office (PMO). The use of funds for PG11, PG12, PG13, PG14, and PG15 will be directly tied to the approved spending plan. The regions must adhere to the project list as provided in the spend plan. 3. Function Codes and SOCs The existing Function Codes and Sub-Object Classes (SOCs) for 192X will be used for fund 192J. Please apply accounting classification codes in accordance with normal coding guidelines depending on the purchase. Please refer to the PBS Standardized Coding website to find more information. 5 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A C. Tracking PBS Operating Expenses Related to BIL At this time, PBS does not plan to issue allowances for operational support from the BIL and all operating costs will be funded from regular FBF fund 192X. It is still necessary to track 192X costs related to executing the BIL projects. Tracking code Y0000BIL was set up in order to track BIL expenses paid for by regular 192X funding. 1. Travel At this time, all travel continues to be paid from 192X BA60. All travel in Concur for a BIL project need to cite the Y0000BIL tracking code. This code has been loaded in Concur for certain organization codes related to BIL. If the coding for your organization does not appear, please contact your Building Operations budget analyst. 2. Labor Coding/Timecarding Every PBS employee is to follow current business rules regarding timecarding their labor hours to function codes, buildings, projects, and reimbursable work authorizations (RWAs). Employees who work on BIL projects need to code their time to the specific projects as normal. Effective with the pay period beginning 9/25/22 (pay period ending 10/08), those who spend administrative time on BIL work need to code their time to Y0000BIL in HRLinks using the region s dummy building number. This does not apply to SES or PMO employees, or to PBS employees who can code time to individual projects or RWAs. Employees who work full time on BIL projects within the LPOE PMO do not need to timecard to the Y-code as their organization code is already delineated as full time BIL. Please see section E.4 for more information on General & Administrative (G&A) allocation. 3. All Other Management Support contract employees who are not working on a specific project must be coded to Sub Object Class H03 (Contract labor) with tracking code, Y0000BIL. The tracking code will enable GSA to separate out embedded contract employees from other types of contracts. The LPOE PMO must be notified of all new management support contracts supporting the BIL prior to award. All other costs not included in a project or in the BIL spend plan, but related to the BIL, such as training, will continue to use the Y0000BIL code for tracking in 192X. D. Requesting BIL Funds BIL funds will be managed by the PMO through internal tracking and spend planning. As regions prepare to make awards, regions should follow the standard allowance 6 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A request process, with BIL process clarifications below, to obtain the project funding in Pegasys. 1. Allowance Process For PG11-PG14, OCFO PBS Budget Division (BBP) will send instructions for regional project and budget teams to create line item project numbers in IRIS. The best practice is for regions to plan to request project allowances for each major project phase, including appropriate contingency, ensuring appropriate time before award, usually once contract awards are pending. The following procedural requirements for issuing allowances shall be followed:   All allowance request packets must be submitted to the allowance request mailbox (allowance.requests@gsa.gov).   The regional program office must coordinate with the zonal budget analyst to prepare the GSA form 3285 allowance request.   A completed GSA Form 3285 is required as an attachment to the allowance request email. The form must be filled out in its entirety to include all regional approving persons, the appropriation, and the amount that the region is requesting. Also, the description section must include which national spend plan the region is requesting funds from and the purpose for how the funds will be obligated. In addition to the GSA Form 3285, regions need to provide any applicable supporting documents to verify the actual award amount, such as, the contractor's proposal (i.e., Standard Form 1442), to support the allowance request.     Note: for all BIL studies (site acquisition, NEPA, pre-design) allowances, regions may provide the Independent Government Estimate as support.   The zonal budget office will then attach the GSA form 3285, supporting documents, spend plan and submit the funds request email to the Central Office allowance request mailbox (allowance.requests@gsa.gov).   Upon receiving the allowance request, BBP will review the allowance request and then forward the request for approval to the LPOE PMO and Office of Portfolio Management & Customer Engagement. Please allow a lead-time of approximately two days for the Central Office to review and concur.   After OCFO approvals have been obtained, BBP will complete the project allowance in Pegasys. After receiving notification that the allowance has been processed, the regional budget analyst must establish an operating plan (A5 level) in Pegasys.   The new PBS project management system, Kahua, will be automating the allowance creation and approval process. Once that feature is implemented, allowances will be created and routed in Kahua. 7 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A E. Pegasys 1. Pegasys Templates New Pegasys templates and budget activities have been added for fund 192J. Accounting templates for the below organization codes have been created for fund 192J. Templates for additional organization codes can be added as needed, please contact BBP with any questions or to request an organization code. Regional Org Codes available for 192J: An LPOE PMO has been established within Region 2. All PMO costs must be coded to organization code P02L0001. Pegasys accounting templates with the P02L0001 organization code have been created for 192X PG60, PG61 and 192J PG15. 2. Purchase Cards (non-travel) Purchase card users must log their BIL-related transactions into Pegasys using fund 192J, and must remember to perform a timely reconciliation. Any purchase must be in accordance with the approved BIL spend plan and directly supporting a BIL project. Regions must follow all current credit card processes; 192J is available in the credit card bot. 3. Reports The following is a list of Pegasys reports that have been created to include fund 192J financial activity. Business Intelligence (BI) databases will be updated to include transactions from 192J. These reports can be found directly in Pegasys or in BI. 8 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A   FR83AB   Allowance/Budget Plan Status Report   Trial Balance Report   Month-end Obligation Status Reports Income & Expense (I&E) Reports     Fixed Asset Trial Balance Report     ULO Database   Quarterly Commitments and Obligations Report for quarterly reporting to Inventory Status Report Congress (as requested in the act) Additionally, activity will be tracked on the below dashboard as updated by PBS and OCFO:   PMO Financial Tracking Report 4. General & Administration Allocation Fund 192J transactions that are coded without a building number, project number or RWA number will go into the various PBS G&A pools; the particular pool classification will depend on the distribution level of the organization code, just as with other Fund 192 indirect transactions. Likewise, fund 192J direct transactions against a particular building will factor into the distribution of the G&A pools just as with other Fund 192 direct transactions. All regions should evaluate the impact of 192J funding on their workloads when determining the new workload factors for FY23 and forward. As most 192J funding is anticipated to be related to capital projects, regions should pay special attention to the impact on the capitalization factors. The Pegasys cost allocation module and the I&E reports will include the 192J fund transactions in with the other Fund 192 transactions to produce one official set of regional and nationwide FBF I&E reports. For more information, please contact Stefanie Crane at 202-528-8178. 5. Cost Transfers Cost transfers occur after funds are expensed. Cost transfers often correct coding errors or reflect changes in coding decisions. They do not require approval by OMB or Congress, but may require explanation after the fact to OMB, Congress or auditors. Cost transfers can be between funds, budget activities, or projects. Because of the BIL's unique requirements for transparency and because of the multiple levels of review for BIL obligations and expenses, cost transfers initiated by regions are strongly discouraged. No cost transfers may be initiated without prior approval from the OCFO Zonal RWA/Capital Projects Director with the concurrence of BBP. Regions shall request cost transfers between the FBF (192X) and the BIL fund (192J) only when the original obligation is clearly in error, or when the identified scope is clearly miscoded. Likewise, regions will request cost transfers between Budget Activities within 192J only when the original obligation is in error. 9 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A All requests for cost transfers must be submitted by the zonal OCFO capital projects budget analyst and must be submitted to the OCFO Zonal RWA/Capital ProjectsDirector for concurrence, and finally to the BBP Capital Projects team for review and concurrence. This process is for approval only. Once the request is approved, the region must transfer the costs by following normal procedures. F. Property In addition to the PBS Property Accounting Handbook, the following guidance is provided to address the specific changes that must be accomplished due to the BIL. 1. Establishing 192J Funded Projects Projects exceeding $50,000 from 192J funds must be assigned a capitalized Accounting System Identification (ASID) in PBS s Inventory Reporting Information System (IRIS), while projects under $50,000 must be assigned an expensed ASID. Because it is PBS  s policy to capitalize at the ASID level, only one ASID should be used even if the project is funded through 192X and 192J. If the ASID is funded by 192X and 192J, IRIS users need to indicate in the appropriate field that the project is multiple funded and select the corresponding Budget Activity. If a project is funded solely from 192J, the ASID number will be assigned based on the type of work conducted, similar to PBS s process under 192X. Each ASID number should tie back to the original project line item number (or LIN) and, while each project can have multiple ASIDs, there must only be one project line item number for each 192J funded project. New construction projects must continue to be assigned N- type ASIDs. These ASIDs will be funded from Budget Activities PG11 (CBP LPOE Five Year Plan Projects), PG12 (AJP Priority LPOE Projects), PG13 (LPOE Paving, Acquisition of Leased LPOE, and FMCSA Projects) and PG14 (Project Contingency). Should a region have a blended new construction/R&A project, please consult with zonal budget and BBP. Repair and Alteration (R&A) projects exceeding the current prospectus limit will continue to be assigned V-type ASIDs for construction and non-advanced design. Currently, there are no advanced design projects that should be assigned S-type ASIDs under 192J. All R&A projects under prospectus will be assigned R-type ASIDs. The spending plan will list the appropriate budget activities and ASID types to be recorded into IRIS for these projects. Traditionally, LPOE project are funded through new construction using N-type ASIDs; however, depending on the scope of the project, the project may need to be coded as a R&A project and could be funded from PG11-PG14 (if deemed necessary and approved by BBP and the Capital Assessment and Allocation Division (PTB)). Should there be any operating costs funded by BIL, ASIDs will not be required for PG15 (Operating Costs). 10 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A PG14 funds will be used as a source for additional project contingency through a stringent governance process managed by the PMO. Regions should plan to stay within the standard construction contingency for their projects, which is already part of the PG11, 12 and 13 project budgets as included in the spend plan. Regions will need approval from the PMO to receive a budget increase from the PG14 program contingency. If approved, funds will be allowed in PG14 and the contingency accounting string will need to be used on the project. Therefore, PG14 costs related to a specific construction project must cite the N, S, V, or R-type ASID for that project and use the same LIN. Fund type 192J: Budget Activity Line item type PG11 PG12 PG13 PG14 PG15 N, L, R N, L, R N, L, R N, L, R n/a ASID type N, V, R N, V, R N, V, R N, V, R R An IRIS National Priority Code is not needed for Fund 192J. IRIS now has the capability to assign ASIDs to the 192J funded budget activities. As previously discussed, IRIS users need to check the multiple fund indicator for the ASID with the appropriate Budget Activity Code in IRIS. For any environmental-related cleanup costs, a separate ASID with expensed accounting treatment will need to be established for any environmental work items. See Chief Financial Officer Manual, Volume 3, OCFO 4260.3 (May 23, 2019), Chapter 5: Expenses, Part 4 for more details. 2. Monitoring Capitalized Projects As PBS receives additional funding under 192J for existing projects, the capitalization status of projects may change since the scope of work and/or dollar amount may change. For example, if a project originally was expensed since it was primarily for repairs, but additional funding allows PBS to improve the asset beyond its original condition, it must be capitalized if it exceeds PBS s capitalization threshold of $50,000. The capitalization threshold is based on the ASID s delivered orders under both funds and under all budget activities. If a project's capitalization status changes, the Regional IRIS Power User must first adjust the work category code and send an email to PBS.Property@gsa.gov informing BGP of the change and reason. The BGP Property Team will then request financial system adjustments as needed. 11 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A Estimated Substantial Completion Date (ESCD): The ESCD is the planned date for the asset to be ready for its intended purpose, regardless of funding code. The estimated SCD should be updated and maintained in IRIS throughout the life of the project. If the scope of work will change due to additional 192J funds, regional associates should adjust the date as soon as a date is established. Additionally, study, design, and construction award dates should also be entered as incurred to ensure IRIS reflects the proper project status. Actual Substantial Completion Date (ASCD): The ASCD is the actual date the asset can be operated or occupied, even though minor repairs or construction may be needed. It is the date when PBS inspects, approves and determines that work has been performed to bring the project to the degree of completion that is necessary for the asset to be used for its intended purpose. Associated construction or physical, or financial completion dates, that are associated with the project shall not delay reporting of the ASCD. Depreciation: Once the project reaches substantial completion and the ASCD is entered into IRIS, project costs will transfer from the construction-in-process to the completed buildings accounts and depreciation will be recorded. The useful lives of projects, which are based on project type, will remain unchanged, regardless if funded completely or partly under fund 192J. For additional information related to Property, please contact Claudine Schleicher at 202-821-8342 or Amber Cochran at 202-236-7258. G. RWA Tracking The following guidance applies to RWA acceptance and processing for RWAs that support GSAs BIL projects, specifically RWAs from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment. Intake Process: Regions will follow standard PBS RWA policy (Reimbursable Work Authorizations National Policy Manual, PBS 1000.2B (August 1, 2020), as revised). In addition, BIL LPOE RWAs must be approved by the LPOE PMO before accepted by PBS. The LPOE PMO will maintain a list of projected CBP RWAs funded with CBP BIL funding. Note: CBP RWAs funded with BIL funding will contain the following TAS, which indicates the RWA is funded from BIL: 070 2022 2026 0530000 *070 is connected to CBP agency bureau code, then the year of the appropriation and the year of expiration of obligational authority. 0530 is an identifier for O&S projects (CBP s BIL projects) 12 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A Reminder: Any B-type RWAs must be associated with a Project Control Number and ASID code connecting it to the GSA-funded portion of the work (usually V-type or N- type). In addition, the associated PCN must be entered in the PCN field in RETA (see screenshot below). For additional assistance please contact your RWA financial point of contact. H. PBS Systems The following PBS systems have been modified to include the new fund 192J financial activity: a. Kahua b. Capital Projects Application (CPA) c. Business Intelligence/Business Objects d. RETA e. Inventory Reporting Information System (IRIS) 13 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A f. REXUS g. ULO database Because these systems rely heavily on templates, not every system can accept every possible combination of fund code, budget activity code, organization code, and project code. If you have trouble entering obligations or other transactions, please first check to be sure that you have made no errors, then contact your local budget analyst for further assistance. I. FY 2022 and Beyond $3.418 billion in BIL funding is available for FY22 and beyond as no-year funding. Beginning with the FY2024 Budget Call, OCFO will start estimating impacts to budgets as a result of any completed BIL projects. For example, utilities, cleaning, and maintenance costs will need to be budgeted in the appropriate fiscal year for any new LPOEs or completed projects coming online. 14 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A",

Background. Lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American interests should not have access to our Nation s secrets, nor should their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts. My Administration must also take appropriate and nec- essary measures to guard against the actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that arise when the Government funds, engages with, or otherwise devotes resources to law firms and their clients that engage in conduct undermining critical American interests and priorities. I have determined that action is necessary to address the significant risks, egregious conduct, and conflicts of interest associated with Susman Godfrey LLP (Susman). Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections. Susman also funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military through the injection of political and radical ideology, and it supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race. Susman itself engages in unlawful discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race. For example, Susman administers a program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities only to  students of color.  My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimi- nation perpetrated in the name of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec. 2. Security Clearance Review. (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applica- ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Susman, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Susman. The heads of agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec. 3. Contracting. (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Susman and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with Susman or with entities that disclose doing business with Susman under subsection (a) of this section. To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall: VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:25 Apr 14, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\15APE0.SGM 15APE0 0 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l 15616 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 71 / Tuesday, April 15, 2025 / Presidential Documents (i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Susman has been hired to perform any service; and (ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Susman or with entities that do business with Susman effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. Sec. 4. Racial Discrimination. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP). Sec. 5. Personnel. (a) The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Susman when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Susman employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States. (b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Susman, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States.

      "Summary": "Here's a comprehensive analysis of the policy document in light of the executive order:\n\n1. Policy Summary:\nThe document is a GSA memorandum providing financial guidance for implementing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), specifically focused on:\n- Establishing new accounting codes (Fund 192J)\n- Creating budget activities for Land Ports of Entry (LPOE) projects\n- Tracking PBS operating expenses related to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)\n- Providing detailed instructions for fund management, project tracking, and financial reporting\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nThe executive order targets Susman Godfrey LLP, alleging:\n- Engaging in activities detrimental to American interests\n- Discriminatory practices\n- Potential national security risks\n\nThe order instructs federal agencies to:\n- Review and suspend security clearances\n- Terminate or review contracts\n- Limit official interactions with the firm\n- Restrict hiring from the firm\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nAfter careful review, this executive order DOES NOT directly impact the GSA infrastructure funding policy document. Reasons:\n- The policy is a technical financial guidance document for IIJA implementation\n- The executive order targets a specific law firm (Susman Godfrey)\n- The policy document does not mention any contracts with or interactions with Susman Godfrey\n- The funding and project guidelines remain unchanged by this order\n\n4. Recommended Next Steps:\nAlthough the executive order does not directly affect this policy, recommended actions include:\n- Maintain current policy implementation\n- Ensure continued transparency in contract and project reporting\n- Review any existing contracts for potential conflicts\n- Continue standard compliance and financial tracking procedures\n\nConclusion: No immediate policy modifications are required based on this executive order.",

      "phase1_response": "TO: Distribution\nFROM: GSA Policy Analyst\nSUBJECT: Analysis of Executive Order 14263 on GSA Memo Dated September 28, 2022\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of Executive Order 14263 (\"Addressing Risks From Susman Godfrey\") and its impact on the GSA memorandum \"Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Financial Guidance\" dated September 28, 2022.\n\n### 1. Summary of Policy Text\n\nThe GSA memorandum provides detailed financial and accounting guidance for the $3.4 billion appropriated to the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The policy establishes new accounting codes (Fund 192J), budget activities, and tracking procedures to manage and report on BIL funds separately from regular FBF funds (192X). It outlines processes for Public Buildings Service (PBS) personnel to request funds, manage projects in GSA's financial systems (Pegasys), and handle contracts, labor coding, and property capitalization for BIL-funded projects, which are primarily focused on Land Ports of Entry (LPOE). The document is fundamentally a \"how-to\" guide for the financial execution of the BIL program within GSA.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text\n\nExecutive Order 14263 directs all executive departments and agencies to take specific actions to address perceived risks associated with the law firm Susman Godfrey LLP (\"Susman\"). Citing allegations of activities detrimental to U.S. interests, including unlawful discrimination and undermining democratic processes, the EO mandates several actions. Key directives include:\n*   Suspending security clearances held by individuals at Susman.\n*   Requiring government contractors to disclose any business they conduct with Susman.\n*   Reviewing and taking steps to terminate existing government contracts where Susman is performing a service or that are held by entities doing business with Susman.\n*   Limiting Susman employees' access to federal facilities and interaction with federal employees.\n*   Restricting the hiring of Susman employees into federal service.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nThe Executive Order applies to and directly affects the execution of the policy outlined in the GSA memorandum. While the memorandum does not name Susman Godfrey or any other specific law firm, its entire purpose is to govern the financial mechanisms through which GSA will obligate and expend $3.4 billion. A significant portion of these funds will be executed via contracts with external vendors for construction, design, management support, and other professional services. The Executive Order imposes new, government-wide requirements on this contracting process.\n\nThe specific points of impact are as follows:\n\n*   **Contracting and Procurement (EO Sec. 3):** This is the most significant area of impact. The GSA memorandum's procedures for requesting allowances (Section D) are directly tied to pending contract awards. The Executive Order now mandates that GSA's procurement process for any BIL-funded project must include a new due diligence step.\n    *   **Disclosure Requirement:** GSA contracting officers must now require all potential contractors for BIL projects to disclose any business they do with Susman Godfrey. This is a new material requirement for all solicitations.\n    *   **Contract Review and Termination:** If an existing or potential contractor discloses a relationship with Susman, GSA is required to review that contract. If Susman is hired to perform any service under that contract, GSA is directed to take steps to terminate it. This adds a critical layer of compliance and risk assessment to the procurement and project management activities governed by the memorandum. For example, a prime construction contractor for an LPOE project that subcontracts legal services to Susman would be in violation of the EO's directive.\n*   **Personnel (EO Sec. 5):** The GSA memorandum applies to a wide range of PBS and OCFO employees, including the LPOE Program Management Office (PMO). These employees are now subject to the EO's prohibitions on engaging with Susman employees in their official capacity and are restricted from hiring Susman employees, affecting GSA's own staffing decisions for program execution.\n*   **Use of Funds:** The memorandum establishes budget activities (e.g., PG11-PG15) and accounting strings for BIL-related expenses. The Executive Order effectively places a new restriction on the use of these funds by prohibiting their flow to Susman, either directly through a GSA contract or indirectly through a prime contractor. This impacts how budget and project managers can execute their approved spending plans.\n\nIn essence, the GSA memorandum provides the financial framework for the BIL program, and the Executive Order adds a critical compliance overlay that dictates with whom GSA and its contractors can and cannot do business.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nTo ensure compliance with Executive Order 14263, the following actions must be taken immediately regarding the execution of BIL funds:\n\n1.  **Issue Supplemental Guidance:** A follow-on memorandum must be issued to the same distribution list as the original policy, notifying all relevant personnel of the new requirements mandated by the Executive Order.\n2.  **Update Procurement and Contracting Procedures:**\n    *   The Office of Acquisition Policy and the Public Buildings Service must immediately develop and incorporate standard language into all new BIL-related solicitations (RFPs, RFQs, etc.) requiring contractors to disclose any business relationship with Susman Godfrey LLP, per Section 3(a) of the EO.\n    *   Guidance must be provided to all Contracting Officers (COs) and Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs) working on BIL projects on how to evaluate these disclosures and the steps to take if a prohibited relationship is identified.\n3.  **Review Existing Contracts and Vendor Files:** The LPOE PMO, in coordination with regional contracting officers, must conduct a review of all existing BIL-related contracts and task orders to identify any potential engagement with Susman Godfrey.\n4.  **Brief Affected Personnel:** All personnel identified in the \"MEMORANDUM FOR\" line of the original policy, particularly those in the LPOE PMO and regional design, construction, and financial offices, must be briefed on the restrictions regarding official interactions with and the hiring of Susman employees.\n5.  **Coordinate with the Office of General Counsel (OGC):** OGC should review the required procurement language and provide legal guidance on the process for contract review and potential termination as stipulated in the EO.\n\n---\n**Final Determination: Affected**",

Its domain is purely internal financial administration, covering topics like new accounting codes (Fund 192J), budget activities, allowance request processes, and the use of GSA's financial systems (Pegasys).\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** Executive Order 14263, \"Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey,\" is a government-wide directive targeting a specific private law firm. Its domain is federal contracting, security clearance, and personnel policy. It directs federal agencies to suspend security clearances, require contractors to disclose business with the named firm, review and potentially terminate associated contracts, and limit the hiring of the firm's employees.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** The Executive Order has a clear, albeit indirect, impact on the activities governed by the GSA policy. The policy provides the financial mechanism and procedures to fund infrastructure projects. These projects are executed through contracts with private sector companies. The Executive Order imposes new, substantive requirements on all federal contracting activities. Therefore, while the EO does not alter the GSA's accounting codes or financial processes themselves, it directly impacts the procurement activities that these financial processes are designed to support. GSA, in executing the BIL projects described in its policy, must now adhere to the EO's requirements for any contract it funds.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:**\n    *   **Policy Text:** The GSA memorandum repeatedly refers to activities that fall under federal procurement rules. For instance, it details the allowance process \"as regions prepare to make awards\" and requires supporting documents like \"the contractor's proposal (i.e., Standard Form 1442).\" It also mentions \"Management Support contract employees.\" These are the precise activities the EO targets.\n    *   **EO Text:** Section 3, \"Contracting,\" is the central provision. It requires that \"Government contracting agencies shall... require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Susman\" and directs agency heads to \"review all contracts with... entities that disclose doing business with Susman.\" GSA is a government contracting agency, and the funds administered under its BIL policy will be used to award such contracts.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** The impact is categorized as indirect because the EO does not amend the text or procedures within the GSA memorandum. GSA can still use Fund 192J and follow its allowance request process. However, the impact is significant and unavoidable. Before an award can be made using the funds managed by this policy, GSA must incorporate the EO's new vetting, disclosure, and review requirements into its procurement process for these projects. The policy governs the 'how to pay,' while the EO governs the 'who can be paid,' creating a direct operational linkage.",

Purpose. Federal regulations should not predetermine economic winners and losers. Yet some regulations operate to exclude new market entrants. Regulations that reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innova- tion as well as the benefits they create for American consumers should be eliminated. This order commences the process for eliminating anti-com- petitive regulations to revitalize the American economy. Sec. 2. Definitions. (a)  Agency  has the meaning given to it in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code, except that it does not include the Executive Office of the President or any components thereof. (b)  Agency head  means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director, unless otherwise specified in this order. Sec. 3. Rescinding Anti-Competitive Regulations. (a) Agency heads shall, in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (Chair- man) and the Attorney General, complete a review of all regulations subject to their rulemaking authority and identify those that: (i) create, or facilitate the creation of, de facto or de jure monopolies; (ii) create unnecessary barriers to entry for new market participants; (iii) limit competition between competing entities or have the effect of limiting competition between competing entities; (iv) create or facilitate licensure or accreditation requirements that unduly limit competition; (v) unnecessarily burden the agency s procurement processes, thereby lim- iting companies  ability to compete for procurements; or (vi) otherwise impose anti-competitive restraints or distortions on the oper- ation of the free market. (b) Within 70 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall each provide to the Chairman and the Attorney General a list of regulations identified by the categories specified in subsection (a) of this section. Agency heads shall also include a recommendation as to whether each of the listed regulations warrants rescission or modification in light of its anti-competitive effects. For recommended modifications, agency heads shall briefly specify what modification is appropriate. For regulations that are anti-competitive by design, agency heads shall provide a justification for their anti-competitive effects if the agency head is not proposing rescission or modification. (c) In conducting the review required by subsection (a) of this section, agency heads shall prioritize review of those rules that satisfy the definition of  significant regulatory action  in Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended. (d) Within 10 days of the date of this order, the Chairman shall issue a request for information (RFI) that seeks public input on the identification of regulations that fall within the categories specified in subsection (a) of this section, as well as comments explaining the proposed classifications. The request shall remain open for 40 days.

(e) Within 90 days of receipt of the agency lists specified in subsection (b) of this section, the Chairman, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the relevant agency heads, shall provide to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) a consolidated list of regulations that warrant rescission or modification in light of their anti-competitive effects, along with rec- ommended modifications. The Chairman may include on the consolidated list regulations not originally included on an agency list if such regulations fall within at least one of the categories outlined in subsections (a)(i)  (vi) of this section. (f) Upon receipt of the consolidated list described in subsection (e) of this section, the OMB Director, through the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, shall consult with the Chairman, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the relevant agency heads to decide whether to incorporate the proposed rescissions or modifications into the Unified Regulatory Agenda developed pursuant to Executive Order 14219 of February 19, 2025 (Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President s  Department of Government Efficiency  Deregulatory Initiative).

Policy Summary:\nThe GSA Policy Statement on Harassment (2325.8A) defines and prescribes guidelines for preventing harassment in the workplace. Key points include:\n- Defines harassment as unwelcome conduct based on group membership\n- Applies to GSA employees, former employees, and job applicants\n- Outlines responsibilities for the Office of Civil Rights, Human Resources, managers, and employees\n- Focuses on maintaining a workplace free from harassment\n- Excludes the Office of Inspector General and Civilian Board of Contract Appeals from full applicability\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nExecutive Order 14267 aims to reduce anti-competitive regulatory barriers by:\n- Requiring agency heads to review regulations that:\n  - Create monopolies\n  - Create barriers to market entry\n  - Limit competition\n  - Impose unnecessary licensure requirements\n  - Burden procurement processes\n- Mandates agencies identify and potentially rescind anti-competitive regulations\n- Involves consultation with the Federal Trade Commission and Attorney General\n- Seeks to revitalize the American economy by eliminating restrictive regulations\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order does NOT directly impact the GSA Harassment Policy because:\n- The policy is an internal workplace conduct guideline\n- It does not create economic barriers or limit market competition\n- The order focuses on economic and regulatory constraints, not workplace conduct policies\n- The harassment policy falls under civil rights and workplace safety, not economic regulation\n\n4.

Summary of GSA Policy 2325.8A\n\nGSA Policy 2325.8A is an internal administrative directive that defines and prescribes the agency's policy on harassment. Its purpose is to ensure a workplace free from sexual and non-sexual harassment, including retaliation. The policy outlines the responsibilities of the Office of Civil Rights, the Office of Human Resources Management, managers, and employees in preventing, reporting, and addressing harassing conduct. It applies to GSA employees, former employees, and applicants, with specific exceptions for the Office of Inspector General and the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals due to their independent personnel authorities. In essence, it is an internal personnel and civil rights policy focused on workplace conduct.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order 14267\n\nExecutive Order 14267 directs federal agencies to review and identify regulations that create unnecessary barriers to economic competition. The stated purpose is to eliminate rules that reduce entrepreneurship, innovation, and the benefits they create for consumers. Agency heads are required to identify regulations that create monopolies, limit market entry, stifle competition between entities, impose undue licensure requirements, burden procurement processes, or otherwise distort the free market. The EO establishes a process for agencies to report these regulations for potential modification or rescission.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nExecutive Order 14267 **does not apply** to GSA Policy 2325.8A. The determination is based on the fundamental difference in the subject matter, scope, and purpose of the two documents.\n\n*   **Subject Matter Mismatch:** The EO is exclusively focused on **economic regulations** that affect the external free market. Its criteria, listed in Section 3(a), are all related to market competition, such as creating monopolies, barriers to entry for new businesses, and limiting competition in procurement. GSA's harassment policy, in contrast, is an **internal personnel policy** concerned with workplace conduct, employee rights, and ensuring a safe and respectful professional environment.\n*   **Scope and Target:** The EO targets \"regulations subject to [agency] rulemaking authority\" that impact external market participants, consumers, and competing businesses. GSA Policy 2325.8A is an internal directive that governs the conduct of GSA's own employees and applicants. It does not regulate any external market, industry, or private-sector activity.\n*   **Failure to Meet Criteria:** The harassment policy does not meet any of the specific criteria for review outlined in Section 3(a) of the EO:\n    *   It does not create or facilitate monopolies.\n    *   It does not create barriers to entry for new market participants.\n    *   It does not limit competition between entities.\n    *   It does not create licensure or accreditation requirements.\n    *   It does not burden the agency's procurement processes to limit competition.\n    *   It does not impose any anti-competitive restraints or distortions on the operation of the free market.\n\nIn summary, the harassment policy is a matter of internal agency administration and management, falling outside the economic and market-based scope of Executive Order 14267.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\n\nBecause GSA Policy 2325.8A is not affected by this Executive Order, no specific compliance actions are required for this policy. It does not need to be included in the list of regulations submitted to the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General as mandated by Section 3(b) of the EO.\n\nGSA's review in response to EO 14267 should proceed by focusing on external-facing regulations, particularly those related to federal procurement, real property, and acquisition services that could potentially impact market competition.\n\n---\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",

Purpose This directive defines and prescribes the GSA policy on harassment (sexual harassment, non- sexual harassment, and sexual misconduct). This policy supports GSA s well-established commitment to providing a workplace free from harassment. This policy ensures that GSA is taking all reasonable steps to prevent harassment from occurring and to address such conduct before it becomes unlawful. 2. Background Harassment in the Federal workplace is defined as any unwelcome conduct, including oral, written, physical or on-line conduct, based on an individual s membership in a group as described in Section 7(b) below. Harassment also includes retaliation, which is adverse action taken against an individual because the individual reported harassment, supported https://insite.gsa.gov/directives-library/general-services-administration-gsa-policy-statement-on-harassment-including-sexual-and-nonsexual 1/4 2/6/25, 2:16 PM General Services Administration (GSA) Policy Statement on Harassment, Including Sexual and Non-sexual another individual s harassment claim, or opposed harassing conduct. 3.

Background. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins, and has never been hacked. As a result of its scarcity and security, Bitcoin is often referred to as  digital gold . Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The United States Government currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a policy to maximize BTC s strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system. Just as it is in our country s interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United States Digital Asset Stockpile that can serve as a secure account for orderly and strategic management of the United States  other digital asset holdings. Sec. 3. Creation and Administration of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  Stra- tegic Bitcoin Reserve,  capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency (agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to sub- section (d) of this section (Government BTC). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Govern- ment BTC held by it to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. Government BTC deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law. (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  United States Digital Asset Stockpile,  capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Stockpile Assets). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Stockpile Assets held by it to the United States Digital Asset Stockpile and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine strategies for responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile in accordance with applicable law.

However, the United States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other than in connection with crimi- nal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. (d)  Government Digital Assets  means all Government BTC and all Stock- pile Assets. The head of each agency shall not sell or otherwise dispose of any Government Digital Assets, except in connection with the Secretary of the Treasury s exercise of his lawful authority and responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, as required by law, or in cases where the Attorney General or other relevant agency head determines that the Government Digital Assets (or the proceeds from the sale or disposition thereof) can and should: (i) be returned to identifiable and verifiable victims of crime; (ii) be used for law enforcement operations; (iii) be equitably shared with State and local law enforcement partners; or (iv) be released to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705, 28 U.S.C. 524(c), 18 U.S.C. 981, or 21 U.S.C. 881. (e) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment considerations for establishing and managing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile going forward, including the accounts in which the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile should be located and the need for any legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order or the proper management and administration of such accounts. Sec. 4. Accounting. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall provide the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets with a full accounting of all Govern- ment Digital Assets in such agency s possession, including any information regarding the custodial accounts in which such Government Digital Assets are currently held that would be necessary to facilitate a transfer of the Government Digital Assets to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or the United States Digital Asset Stockpile. If such agency holds no Government Digital Assets, such agency shall confirm such fact to the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets within 30 days of the date of this order. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. 6 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:24 Mar 10, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\11MRE3.SGM 11MRE3 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 46 / Tuesday, March 11, 2025 / Presidential Documents 11791 (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

      "Summary": "Analysis of GSA Policy Statement on Harassment and Executive Order 14233\n\n1. Policy Summary:\nThe GSA Policy Statement on Harassment (Number 2325.8A) is a comprehensive directive that:\n- Defines harassment in the federal workplace\n- Establishes responsibilities for preventing and addressing harassment\n- Applies to GSA employees, former employees, and job applicants\n- Covers sexual harassment, non-sexual harassment, and sexual misconduct\n- Outlines reporting and investigation procedures\n- Includes specific exceptions for the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA)\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nExecutive Order 14233 establishes:\n- A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\n- A United States Digital Asset Stockpile\n- Procedures for managing government-owned digital assets\n- Reporting requirements for federal agencies regarding digital asset holdings\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order does NOT directly impact the GSA Harassment Policy for the following reasons:\n- The executive order focuses exclusively on digital asset management\n- The harassment policy deals with workplace conduct and employee protections\n- There are no provisions in the executive order that modify workplace harassment policies\n- The policy's scope and objectives remain unchanged\n\n4. Compliance Next Steps:\nNo immediate action is required to align the harassment policy with this executive order. However, standard organizational best practices suggest:\n- Maintaining current harassment prevention protocols\n- Continuing to enforce existing anti-harassment guidelines\n- Keeping the policy document updated through regular reviews\n- Monitoring any future executive orders that might impact workplace policies\n\nRecommendation: No policy modification is necessary based on Executive Order 14233.",

Summary of GSA Policy 2325.8A ADM\n\nGSA Policy Statement 2325.8A ADM defines and prescribes the agency's policy on all forms of harassment, including sexual and non-sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and retaliation. The policy's stated purpose is to support GSA\u2019s commitment to a workplace free from harassment and to ensure that the agency takes all reasonable steps to prevent and address such conduct. It outlines the responsibilities of the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), the Office of Human Resources Management (OHRM), managers, supervisors, and employees in maintaining a harassment-free environment. The policy applies to all GSA employees, former employees, and applicants, with specific exceptions for the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA). This specific version of the policy was signed on August 21, 2023, and is noted as being canceled on February 6, 2025.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order 14233\n\nExecutive Order 14233, issued on March 6, 2025, establishes a national policy to create a \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\" and a \"United States Digital Asset Stockpile.\" The order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish offices to administer these accounts. The assets funding these reserves are primarily Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets that the U.S. Government holds as a result of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. The EO requires all federal agencies to conduct an accounting of any such \"Government Digital Assets\" in their possession within 30 days and report their findings to the Secretary of the Treasury. It also sets guidelines for the transfer, management, and potential disposition of these assets.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Applicability\n\nExecutive Order 14233 **does not apply to or affect** GSA Policy 2325.8A ADM. The two documents operate in entirely separate and unrelated domains of federal policy and administration.\n\n*   **Subject Matter:** The GSA policy is a personnel and civil rights directive focused on workplace conduct, human behavior, and the prevention of harassment. Its entire scope is limited to the interactions between and responsibilities of GSA employees. In contrast, the Executive Order is a fiscal and asset management directive focused on the accounting, custody, and strategic management of a specific class of government property: cryptocurrency and other digital assets.\n*   **Jurisdiction and Scope:** The GSA policy governs the conduct of people within the agency. The Executive Order governs the management of non-human assets held by federal agencies. There is no topical overlap between preventing workplace harassment and managing a national stockpile of forfeited digital assets.\n*   **Agency Obligations:** While the Executive Order imposes obligations on GSA as a federal agency (specifically, the requirement to inventory and report any holdings of forfeited digital assets), these obligations fall within the purview of GSA's financial or asset management offices, such as the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), not the Office of Civil Rights or the Office of Human Resources Management, which are responsible for the harassment policy. The actions required by the EO have no bearing on the content, purpose, or implementation of the anti-harassment policy.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\n\nAs the executive order does not affect the policy, **no steps are required to bring Policy 2325.8A ADM into compliance with EO 14233.**\n\nThe obligations created by EO 14233 for the GSA as a whole would need to be addressed by the appropriate GSA offices responsible for asset management. This would involve conducting the required 30-day accounting of any \"Government Digital Assets\" held by GSA and reporting the findings to the Secretary of the Treasury. This process is entirely independent of the agency's harassment policy.\n\n***\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",

Its purpose is to define and prohibit harassment (both sexual and non-sexual), establish a process for reporting and investigating such conduct, and assign responsibilities to GSA employees and leadership to maintain a harassment-free workplace. This is an internal agency policy concerning civil rights and employee behavior.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** The executive order, EO 14233, operates in the domain of national financial policy and asset management. Its purpose is to establish a \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\" and a \"United States Digital Asset Stockpile\" under the administration of the Secretary of the Treasury. The order mandates that federal agencies account for and transfer their holdings of forfeited digital currencies to these new reserves.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** There is no direct or indirect impact of EO 14233 on GSA Policy 2325.8A ADM. The two documents are thematically and operationally unrelated. The executive order concerns the management of a specific class of government assets (cryptocurrency), while the policy concerns the rules of conduct for government employees. The EO's requirement for GSA to potentially account for and transfer digital assets is a financial/administrative task; it does not alter the definitions, responsibilities, or procedures outlined in GSA's anti-harassment policy. The standards of behavior for GSA employees performing their duties, including any duties arising from this EO, would still be governed by the existing, unaffected harassment policy.\n\n4.  **Key language or provisions that support your determination:**\n    *   **Policy Purpose:** \"This directive defines and prescribes the GSA policy on harassment (sexual harassment, non-sexual harassment, and sexual misconduct).

It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United States Digital Asset Stockpile...\" This language establishes a financial and strategic objective, with no mention of personnel matters, workplace culture, or civil rights.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment:** One might consider whether GSA holds any forfeited digital assets that would subject it to the EO's directives. Even if GSA does, its obligation is limited to accounting for and transferring these assets. This administrative function does not create a new context for harassment or modify the existing policy. The policy on harassment is a foundational rule of workplace conduct that applies to all work performed by GSA employees, regardless of the specific task. The EO does not intersect with the substance of this rule in any way. Therefore, the policy is not affected.",

Even if GSA does, its obligation is limited to accounting for and transferring these assets. This administrative function does not create a new context for harassment or modify the existing policy. The policy on harassment is a foundational rule of workplace conduct that applies to all work performed by GSA employees, regardless of the specific task. The EO does not intersect with the substance of this rule in any way. Therefore, the policy is not affected."

Background. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins, and has never been hacked. As a result of its scarcity and security, Bitcoin is often referred to as  digital gold . Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The United States Government currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a policy to maximize BTC s strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system. Just as it is in our country s interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United States Digital Asset Stockpile that can serve as a secure account for orderly and strategic management of the United States  other digital asset holdings. Sec. 3. Creation and Administration of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  Stra- tegic Bitcoin Reserve,  capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency (agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to sub- section (d) of this section (Government BTC). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Govern- ment BTC held by it to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. Government BTC deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law. (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  United States Digital Asset Stockpile,  capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Stockpile Assets). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Stockpile Assets held by it to the United States Digital Asset Stockpile and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine strategies for responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile in accordance with applicable law.

However, the United States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other than in connection with crimi- nal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. (d)  Government Digital Assets  means all Government BTC and all Stock- pile Assets. The head of each agency shall not sell or otherwise dispose of any Government Digital Assets, except in connection with the Secretary of the Treasury s exercise of his lawful authority and responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, as required by law, or in cases where the Attorney General or other relevant agency head determines that the Government Digital Assets (or the proceeds from the sale or disposition thereof) can and should: (i) be returned to identifiable and verifiable victims of crime; (ii) be used for law enforcement operations; (iii) be equitably shared with State and local law enforcement partners; or (iv) be released to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705, 28 U.S.C. 524(c), 18 U.S.C. 981, or 21 U.S.C. 881. (e) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment considerations for establishing and managing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile going forward, including the accounts in which the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile should be located and the need for any legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order or the proper management and administration of such accounts. Sec. 4. Accounting. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall provide the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets with a full accounting of all Govern- ment Digital Assets in such agency s possession, including any information regarding the custodial accounts in which such Government Digital Assets are currently held that would be necessary to facilitate a transfer of the Government Digital Assets to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or the United States Digital Asset Stockpile. If such agency holds no Government Digital Assets, such agency shall confirm such fact to the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets within 30 days of the date of this order. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. 6 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:24 Mar 10, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\11MRE3.SGM 11MRE3 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 46 / Tuesday, March 11, 2025 / Presidential Documents 11791 (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

      "Summary": "Here's a comprehensive policy analysis:\n\n1. GSA Climate Crisis Policy Summary:\nThe policy (ADM 1100.1) provides a framework for GSA's response to the climate crisis, focusing on:\n- Achieving net zero operational and procurement-related carbon emissions\n- Adapting facilities, operations, and supply chains to climate conditions\n- Implementing Executive Order 14057's sustainability goals, including:\n  - 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030\n  - 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035\n  - Net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045\n  - 65% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nExecutive Order 14233 establishes:\n- A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\n- A United States Digital Asset Stockpile\n- Focuses on managing government-held digital assets, particularly Bitcoin\n- Requires agencies to report and potentially transfer digital assets to Treasury\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order does NOT directly impact the GSA Climate Crisis policy. The documents address completely different domains:\n- The GSA policy focuses on environmental sustainability\n- The executive order focuses on digital asset management\n\n4. Recommended Next Steps:\nWhile no direct compliance actions are needed, GSA should:\n- Continue implementing the existing climate crisis policy\n- Maintain standard reporting procedures for digital assets if requested by Treasury\n- Ensure any digital assets are reported through standard Treasury channels\n- Continue pursuing existing sustainability goals outlined in the original policy\n\nConclusion: The Executive Order 14233 does not materially affect the GSA Climate Crisis policy (ADM 1100.1). Existing sustainability efforts should continue uninterrupted.",

Summary of Policy Text (GSA Order ADM 1100.1)\n\nGSA Order ADM 1100.1, issued on January 25, 2023, establishes the implementation framework for GSA's response to the climate crisis. The policy's primary objectives are to achieve \"net zero\" carbon emissions in GSA's operations and procurement activities, and to adapt GSA facilities and supply chains to be resilient against current and future climate conditions. The order is a direct response to E.O. 14057, \"Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability,\" and outlines GSA\u2019s strategy for meeting government-wide goals related to clean electricity, zero-emission vehicles, and sustainable buildings.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text (E.O. 14233)\n\nE.O. 14233, issued on March 6, 2025, directs the establishment of a \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\" and a \"United States Digital Asset Stockpile.\" The purpose is to formalize the management of digital assets held by the U.S. Government, primarily those acquired through civil and criminal asset forfeiture. The Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with creating and administering these reserves. The E.O. sets a policy to hold forfeited Bitcoin (BTC) as a strategic reserve and to responsibly manage other forfeited digital assets. A key provision in Section 4 requires the head of *each* executive agency to provide the Secretary of the Treasury with a full accounting of all government-held digital assets within 30 days.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nThe subject matter of E.O. 14233 does not directly affect the substance, goals, or implementation of GSA Order ADM 1100.1.\n\n*   **Divergent Subject Matter:** GSA Order ADM 1100.1 is exclusively focused on climate change, sustainability, energy consumption, federal procurement of sustainable goods and services, and the physical infrastructure of government buildings. E.O. 14233 is exclusively focused on financial policy, specifically the management of digital assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There is no topical overlap between the two directives.\n*   **No Conflict or Amendment:** The new E.O. does not amend, supersede, or conflict with any of the climate-related goals or mandates in GSA's policy or the underlying E.O. 14057. The actions GSA is taking to reduce emissions\u2014such as retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency or electrifying the federal fleet\u2014are entirely separate from the management of digital financial assets.\n*   **Agency-Level vs. Policy-Level Impact:** While the *policy itself* is not affected, E.O. 14233 does impose a new, unrelated administrative requirement on GSA *as an agency*. Section 4 mandates that all agencies, including GSA, must conduct an inventory of any digital assets they possess and report their findings to the Department of the Treasury. This is a general administrative task that falls upon the agency as a whole, rather than a specific directive that alters the climate policy's framework or objectives.\n\nIn summary, the implementation of GSA's climate response policy is not impacted. However, GSA must comply with the E.O.'s separate, agency-wide reporting requirement.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nBecause the policy itself is not affected, no revisions to GSA Order ADM 1100.1 are necessary. However, to ensure agency-wide compliance with E.O. 14233, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1.  **Tasking:** The GSA Administrator should formally task the GSA Chief Financial Officer (CFO), in coordination with GSA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) and any other relevant offices that might handle asset forfeitures, to lead the agency's response to the E.O.\n2.  **Internal Audit:** The designated office must conduct a comprehensive review to determine if GSA possesses any \"Government Digital Assets\" as defined in the E.O. This would primarily include any cryptocurrencies that may have been forfeited to GSA as part of criminal or civil proceedings.\n3.  **Reporting:**\n    *   If GSA is found to hold such assets, a full accounting must be prepared for submission to the Secretary of the Treasury and the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.\n    *   If no such assets are held, GSA must prepare a formal confirmation of this fact for submission.\n4.  **Submission:** This report or confirmation must be completed and submitted within the 30-day deadline (by approximately April 5, 2025) as stipulated in Section 4 of the E.O.\n\n---\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",

Its purpose is to establish a framework for GSA to achieve \"net zero\" carbon emissions in its operations and procurement, and to adapt its infrastructure to be resilient to climate change. The key areas of concern are greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, zero-emission vehicles, and sustainable building practices.\n\n2.  **Executive Order Domain/Subject Area:** Executive Order 14233, \"Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,\" operates entirely within the domain of financial and economic policy. Its core purpose is to create a formal structure for the U.S. government to manage, hold, and account for digital assets (primarily Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies) that it acquires, largely through asset forfeiture.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Impact:** A thorough review confirms there is no direct or indirect impact of EO 14233 on GSA Policy 1100.1ADM.\n    *   **No Direct Mandates:** The executive order does not contain any language or directives related to climate change, energy consumption, carbon emissions, procurement standards, or infrastructure resilience. Its mandates are directed at the Secretary of the Treasury and other agencies regarding the accounting and stewardship of digital financial assets.\n    *   **No Overlapping Responsibilities:** The actions required by the GSA policy (e.g., reducing building emissions, acquiring electric vehicles) are completely separate from the actions required by the EO (e.g., inventorying and transferring forfeited digital assets to the Treasury). The EO may require GSA to report on any digital assets it holds, but this is a purely administrative and financial function that does not alter GSA's operational or procurement policies related to climate change.\n    *   **Separate Spheres of Influence:** The policy governs GSA's management of physical assets, energy, and supply chains.

However, this is a very high-level, indirect, and speculative argument. The EO itself does not promote or mandate cryptocurrency mining; it focuses on managing existing assets obtained through law enforcement actions. This potential second-order effect does not create a direct conflict with or change to the implementation of the GSA's internal climate policy. The GSA's mandate to reduce its own operational emissions remains unchanged.\n\nBased on this analysis, the executive order on digital assets has no bearing on the implementation or objectives of the GSA's climate crisis policy.

Purpose. This Leasing Alert issues policy and guidance for incorporating electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) requirements into leases and Requests for Lease Proposals (RLPs). 2. Background. Per Executive Order 14057, Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability, all agency light-duty vehicle acquisitions must be zero-emission vehicles by the end of FY 2027. This requirement may necessitate the installation of EVSE as part of an agency s mission for normal operations. In October 2022, the Office of Leasing released preliminary internal guidance regarding EVSE and Leases. This Leasing Alert memorializes existing guidance, recommendations, and best practices surrounding the addition of EVSE into new and existing leases. 3. Effective Date. This Leasing Alert and attachments are effective immediately. 4. Applicability. This Leasing Alert applies to all General Services Administration (GSA) real property leasing activities that include requirements for Government- Owned Vehicles (GOVs), and to all those leasing activities delegated by GSA to other Federal agencies that include requirements for U.S. General Services Administration 1800 F Street, NW Washington, DC 20405-0002 www.gsa.gov 1 DocuSign Envelope ID: 6B5E0458-232E-4D7E-B338-8092B8ECA23C LA-23-08 Government-Owned Vehicles (GOVs).

Attachment 3 - CAAC Letter 2022-04 Supplement 1 Sample letter Approving Lessor use of FAS Schedule BPAs 8. Policy. a. General. i. The Lease Amendment should state the government s intention regarding the EVSE. If the Government chooses to remove the EVSE(s), the deinstallation must be done by a qualified contractor. ii. Within this policy,  agency  refers to the agency occupant of the Space. b. Adding EVSE to New or Existing Leases. i. EVSE requests for government-owned vehicles (GOVs) are considered tenant-specific improvements. The scope of tenant- specific improvements are not part of the lease template but are attached as an additional requirement of the lease (e.g.,  Special Requirements  exhibit). ii. EVSE requests should be requested by the tenant agency and will be addressed on a lease-by-lease basis depending on agency requirements, as: 1. Tenant improvements (TI) when the scope is associated with the procurement of a new lease; Page 2 of 17 DocuSign Envelope ID: 6B5E0458-232E-4D7E-B338-8092B8ECA23C LA-23-08 a. During the requirements development process and again when drafting the RLP, project teams should work with client agencies, using the Electric Vehicle the Suitability Assessment Tool, appropriate number of EVSEs that should be required as part of the lease procurement. to determine 2. Alterations when requested during the term of an existing lease; or 3. Agency equipment when GSA or the agency purchases an EVSE that is not connected to the building s electrical power and does not require installation or permanent attachment to the building. In these cases, the agency is responsible for all operations and maintenance. iii. Agencies should submit a written request of the EVSE requirement to their regional leasing point of contact (i.e., client planning manager, account manager, leasing specialist/LCO, Lease Acquisition Manager). In accordance with 40 U.S.C. (C) (4), a written determination must be made to set forth the circumstances that make the improvement advantageous and show that the total cost for the expected life of the lease is less than the cost of alternative space not needing repair, alteration, or improvement. For more information, consult Leasing Desk Guide Chapter 8, Section 2. iv. For delegated leases, agencies will pursue EVSE requirements in accordance with lease procurement or alteration requirements. v. Prior to any installation of EVSE as a lease alteration, a site assessment may need to be completed by a qualified professional to determine building load capacity, utility grid capacity, installation requirements, suggested physical location of charging units, etc. See Attachment 2 for a statement of work (SOW) template for EVSE site assessments that can be used for site assessment planning and gauging feasibility and pricing of EVSE projects. 1. Note. For larger installation projects, site assessments are strongly recommended. Page 3 of 17 DocuSign Envelope ID: 6B5E0458-232E-4D7E-B338-8092B8ECA23C LA-23-08 2. Note. Any costs associated with site assessments are agency-reimbursable. 3. Note. Site assessments should be completed through a lease amendment. If the lessor is unwilling to complete the site assessment, but is willing to allow GSA to complete the assessment, GSA s Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) should be used. For more information on the BPA, see GSA Fleet Management s page. vi. EVSEs being installed in leases as a TI or Alteration must have point- of-sale capability, access control, and GSA Fleet Wright Express, Inc.  (WEX card) capability. (Note: Point-of-sale capability allows the user to pay for their electricity with a card/app and prevents the administrative burden of annual RWAs to pay for electricity and periodic electrical usage reconciliation with the lessor.) It is recommended that the charger be able to track detailed usage. For more information on the GSA Fleet WEX Card, see Gsa.gov. c. Cybersecurity. EVSEs being installed in leases as TI or Alterations must meet cybersecurity requirements. The most efficient way to achieve this is to allow the Lessor access to the Federal Supply Schedules Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for EVSE purchases, as all EVSEs on the BPA have been reviewed and approved for government use. (See Supplement 1 to Class Deviation CD-2022-04). If the Lessor does not use equipment purchased through the BPA, they must use FEDRAMP approved or FEDRAMP sponsored equipment. If the lessor proposed equipment is not FEDRAMP approved or FEDRAMP sponsored, the customer agency must sponsor said equipment for FEDRAMP approval, including taking on the associated costs of that sponsorship, in order to use that equipment. i. Note: See Attachment #3 for CAAC Letter 2022-04 Supplement 1 to allow access to GSA BPA. ii. Note: For GSA delegated leases, use your agency s own review and approval process for EVSE equipment. d. Operations, Maintenance and Network Connectivity. Page 4 of 17 DocuSign Envelope ID: 6B5E0458-232E-4D7E-B338-8092B8ECA23C LA-23-08 i. If EVSE is being added as an alteration, the LCO must negotiate with the lessor and memorialize in a lease amendment which party is responsible for the EVSE charger s operation, maintenance, and replacement. (See Lease Amendment Template paragraphs 6 7) ii. If EVSE is part of the special requirements for the initial lease procurement, the LCO must specify in the lease which party is responsible for the operation, maintenance, replacement, and utilities of the charger. iii. Internet, wi-fi, and other network services may be included in standard operating costs, if they are necessary and incidental to EVSE chargers. LA-18-07, Payment for Extended, Multi-Shift, or Continuous Mission-Related Services in Leases promotes the inclusion of mission-related requirements for recurring utility services into a lease s operating rent. e. EVSE Considerations. i. Lease Terms. Prior to awarding any alterations project, leasing specialists should consider the number of years that are remaining under the current lease. The Government should avoid investing substantive lump sum funding in leases that are due to expire in the near future. As outlined in the Leasing Desk Guide Chapter 8 Alterations leasing specialists must give consideration to  early exercise of any existing renewal option, cancellation of the lease and procuring new space, acquiring a succeeding lease, or acquiring a superseding lease  before contracting for alterations. in Leased Space, ii. Prospectus Rates: The addition of EVSE operating costs into a rental agreement does not violate a fully authorized prospectus unless the approved rate for the prospectus is already inclusive of the specific services that are being added to the lease. For prospectus projects still under development, the proposed prospectus must account for the new EVSE requirement when setting a rent limitation. iii. Other Charging options: When EVSE installation is impractical or otherwise not possible, leasing specialists should work with the agency to suggest alternatives such as public charging stations, home-to-work charging, or hybrid vehicles that do not require a Page 5 of 17 DocuSign Envelope ID: 6B5E0458-232E-4D7E-B338-8092B8ECA23C LA-23-08 charging station. f. Parking and Accessibility. i. EVSEs intended solely for government use can only be installed in parking areas where GSA has a leasehold interest. For this reason, the Government can only pay for EVSE to be installed if a lease includes assigned parking space(s) reserved for the exclusive use of the Government. ii. All lease EVSE installations must conform to the U.S. Access Board s Guide to the ABA Accessibility Standards.

Policy. American citizens deserve an excellent and efficient Federal workforce that attracts the highest caliber of civil servants committed to achieving the freedom, prosperity, and democratic rule that our Constitution promotes. But current Federal hiring practices are broken, insular, and out- dated. They no longer focus on merit, practical skill, and dedication to our Constitution. Federal hiring should not be based on impermissible factors, such as one s commitment to illegal racial discrimination under the guise of  equity,  or one s commitment to the invented concept of  gender iden- tity  over sex. Inserting such factors into the hiring process subverts the will of the People, puts critical government functions at risk, and risks losing the best-qualified candidates. By making our recruitment and hiring processes more efficient and focused on serving the Nation, we will ensure that the Federal workforce is prepared to help achieve American greatness, and attracts the talent necessary to serve our citizens effectively. By significantly improving hiring principles and practices, Americans will receive the Federal resources and services they deserve from the highest-skilled Federal workforce in the world. Sec. 2. Federal Hiring Plan. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the Administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), shall develop and send to agency heads a Federal Hiring Plan that brings to the Federal workforce only highly skilled Americans dedicated to the furtherance of American ideals, values, and interests. (b) This Federal Hiring Plan shall: (i) prioritize recruitment of individuals committed to improving the effi- ciency of the Federal government, passionate about the ideals of our American republic, and committed to upholding the rule of law and the United States Constitution; (ii) prevent the hiring of individuals based on their race, sex, or religion, and prevent the hiring of individuals who are unwilling to defend the Constitution or to faithfully serve the Executive Branch; (iii) implement, to the greatest extent possible, technical and alternative assessments as required by the Chance to Compete Act of 2024; (iv) decrease government-wide time-to-hire to under 80 days; (v) improve communication with candidates to provide greater clarity regarding application status, timelines, and feedback, including regular updates on the progress of applications and explanations of hiring decisions where appropriate; (vi) integrate modern technology to support the recruitment and selection process, including the use of data analytics to identify trends, gaps, and VerDate Sep<11>2014 18:45 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE9.SGM 30JAE9 5 1 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l 8622 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents opportunities in hiring, as well as leveraging digital platforms to improve candidate engagement; and (vii) ensure Department and Agency leadership, or their designees, are active participants in implementing the new processes and throughout the full hiring process. (c) This Federal Hiring Plan shall include specific agency plans to improve the allocation of Senior Executive Service positions in the Cabinet agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Management and Budget, the Small Business Administration, the Social Security Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration, to best facilitate democratic leadership, as required by law, within each agency. (d) The Federal Hiring Plan shall provide specific best practices for the human resources function in each agency, which each agency head shall implement, with advice and recommendations as appropriate from DOGE. Sec. 3. Accountability and Reporting. (a) The Director of the Office of Per- sonnel Management shall establish clear performance metrics to evaluate the success of these reforms, and request agency analysis on a regular basis. (b) The Office of Personnel Management shall consult with Federal agen- cies, labor organizations, and other stakeholders to monitor progress and ensure that the reforms are meeting the needs of both candidates and agencies. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals; or (iii) the functions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee relating to its conduct of monetary policy.

      "Summary": "Policy Analysis Summary\n\n1. Policy Summary (LA-23-08):\nThe GSA Public Buildings Service issued a Leasing Alert on Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) requirements. The policy provides guidance for incorporating EVSE into federal leases, stemming from Executive Order 14057's mandate for zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by the end of FY 2027. The document outlines procedures for adding EVSE to new and existing leases, including site assessments, cybersecurity requirements, and operational considerations.\n\n2. Executive Order Summary (EO 14170):\nThe executive order focuses on reforming the federal hiring process, emphasizing merit-based recruitment and establishing a new Federal Hiring Plan. Key aspects include reducing time-to-hire, improving candidate communication, and integrating modern technology in the hiring process.\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order does NOT directly affect the EVSE policy (LA-23-08). The primary focus of EO 14170 is on federal hiring practices, while the EVSE policy addresses infrastructure and vehicle charging requirements. The policy's technical and operational guidance remains unchanged by this hiring-focused executive order.\n\n4. Compliance and Next Steps:\nNo immediate actions are required for the EVSE policy. However, regional GSA teams should:\n- Continue implementing the existing EVSE guidelines\n- Monitor any future executive orders that might impact infrastructure or procurement processes\n- Maintain documentation of EVSE implementation efforts\n- Ensure ongoing compliance with the original Executive Order 14057 regarding zero-emission vehicles\n\nRecommendation: Continue current EVSE implementation strategies without modification based on this executive order.",

      "phase1_response": "TO: GSA Leadership\nFROM: Policy Analysis Division\nDATE: October 26, 2023\nSUBJECT: Analysis of Executive Order 14170 on GSA Leasing Alert LA-23-08 (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment)\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of Executive Order (EO) 14170, \"Reforming the Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Service,\" and its potential impact on GSA Public Buildings Service Leasing Alert LA-23-08, \"Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment.\"\n\n### 1. Summary of Policy Text (Leasing Alert LA-23-08)\nGSA Leasing Alert LA-23-08 provides official policy and guidance for incorporating Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) into new and existing federal leases. Driven by Executive Order 14057 on federal sustainability, its purpose is to facilitate the installation of charging stations for Government-Owned Vehicles (GOVs). The policy details the procedures for handling EVSE requests as tenant-specific improvements, conducting site assessments to determine building electrical capacity, ensuring technical and cybersecurity standards are met (e.g., WEX card capability, using GSA Schedule BPAs), and outlining responsibilities for operations and maintenance within the lease agreement. It is fundamentally a policy governing real property, procurement, and infrastructure.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text (EO 14170)\nExecutive Order 14170, \"Reforming the Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Service,\" directs a comprehensive overhaul of the federal government's personnel recruitment and hiring practices. Its stated policy is to move away from current hiring practices it deems \"broken\" and refocus on merit, practical skills, and dedication to the U.S. Constitution. The EO mandates the creation of a \"Federal Hiring Plan\" to streamline the hiring process, reduce time-to-hire, implement new assessment methods, and ensure that agency leadership is actively involved in recruitment. The scope of this order is exclusively centered on human resources, personnel management, and the civil service workforce.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\nThis executive order **does not apply to or affect** GSA Leasing Alert LA-23-08. The two documents address entirely separate and unrelated domains of federal government operations.\n\n*   **Subject Matter:** The Leasing Alert is a policy focused on **real property management and asset procurement**. It dictates the process for modifying physical spaces (leased buildings) to accommodate equipment (EV chargers). Its core components involve lease amendments, statements of work, and technical specifications for hardware. In contrast, the Executive Order is a policy focused on **human resources and personnel management**. It dictates the process for recruiting, assessing, and hiring federal employees.\n\n*   **Target Audience and Function:** The Leasing Alert is directed at GSA Regional Commissioners, Leasing Directors, and Lease Acquisition Officers\u2014personnel responsible for managing the government's real estate portfolio. The Executive Order is directed at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and agency heads to reform the functions of their human resources departments.\n\n*   **Lack of Overlap:** There are no provisions within EO 14170 that touch upon leasing, government property, fleet management, sustainability infrastructure, or procurement of equipment. Likewise, Leasing Alert LA-23-08 contains no provisions related to hiring, employee qualifications, civil service rules, or recruitment. The policy governs *how to put a charger in a building*, while the executive order governs *how to hire the person who works in that building*.\n\nTherefore, the directives and reforms mandated by EO 14170 have no bearing on the procedures, policies, or guidance established in Leasing Alert LA-23-08.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\nNo action is required to bring Leasing Alert LA-23-08 into compliance with Executive Order 14170. The policy is not affected. GSA personnel responsible for leasing activities should continue to implement the guidance in LA-23-08 as written.\n\n***\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",

The U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) Public Buildings Service (PBS) is committed to integrating risk management and forward-looking science-based climate information into its decision-making processes, programs, operations, business models, and disaster response functions. PBS will use forward-looking science-based climate information to shape investment decisions for long-term hold assets. This enables PBS to develop and integrate adaptive strategies to manage and reduce the risk of operational or financial consequences to both individual facilities and the broader portfolio of owned assets. It also supports reliable performance in changing conditions over assets  intended service lifespans. This Order seeks to manage risks due to observed and expected changes in the environment. To account for the increased frequency of extreme weather and climate- related events, this Order supports the development of a coordinated risk management approach and integrated strategies for reliable and cost effective operations in changing conditions and to secure and safeguard GSA-controlled public assets. This Order complements related laws, GSA policies, Orders, and regulations by affirming that PBS is systematically preparing for changes in the frequency, intensity, duration and geographic distribution of extreme weather-related events and the effects of climate change. PBS is also planning how to manage risk, and how to provide reliable performance in changing conditions over assets  intended asset service lives. This shall be accomplished by integrating risk management and adaptation strategies into all PBS programs, operations, and business models, including portfolio planning and disaster response, for current and future conditions. 2. Background. PBS acquires, designs, builds, operates, leases, and disposes of space for the Federal Government. Given the breadth of PBS s responsibilities, the known and unforeseen vulnerabilities due to the observed and expected changes in the environment and the increased frequency and intensity of weather and natural disasters are having and will DocuSign Envelope ID: EB036CCD-245A-4ADA-A165-0DD7427071E2 PBS 1099.1 continue to have significant impacts on PBS s ability to effectively fulfill its mission to support its customers, coordinate with local communities, operate its facilities, maintain financial stability, avoid maladaptation, and meet its policy requirements. These impacts reflect the timescales of both short-term and slow-onset change, as well as preparing for increased frequency, intensity, duration and geographic distribution of events, and the planning and implementation required for adaptation. Integrating risk management and adaptation strategies into programs, operations and business models, including disaster response and consideration of impacts to local communities surrounding GSA facilities, will enable PBS to execute and manage its mission, operations, and finances securely, effectively, efficiently, and in an environmentally just manner in current and future conditions. 3. Scope and Applicability. This Order and any companion guidance documents apply to all real property management and operation activities for Federal buildings under GSA s jurisdiction, custody, or control, including all buildings delegated to other Federal agencies by the Administrator of General Services. This Order applies to all PBS program actions, including, but not limited to: real property portfolio and asset management; customer engagement; design and construction for new buildings and the alteration of existing buildings; overall building operations and maintenance, and to the extent applicable, leases. 4. Policy. PBS will continue to develop, prioritize, implement, and evaluate actions; and will consider impacts to local communities to integrate plausible projected solutions to vulnerabilities into its mission, programs, management functions, and decision points. This will enable PBS to continually evaluate and manage the short and long term risks to safeguarding assets. PBS will consider and address such impacts when undertaking long-term planning, setting priorities for research and investigations, and informing decisions affecting PBS resources, programs, acquisitions, policies, and operations. 5. Responsibilities. PBS shall consider local coordination, facilities risk management, and adaptation in all its decision making. PBS will ensure that its actions protect and safeguard its assets from current and projected extreme weather impacts and the effects of climate change. Decision makers will ensure that they have reviewed and fully understand the financial and operational impacts and the risks and consequences of each decision, before making any such decision. Review and management of identified safeguarding asset risks will be included in senior leadership performance plans from fiscal year 2024 onward. 2 DocuSign Envelope ID: EB036CCD-245A-4ADA-A165-0DD7427071E2 PBS 1099.1 Capital Projects: PBS Office of Portfolio Management and Customer Engagement (PTCE) and PBS Office of Design and Construction (ODC) shall continue to consider the climate hazards and risks in the selection, design, and delivery of capital projects; accept or mitigate identified risks; and share these risks with GSA Enterprise Risk Management. Existing Buildings: PTCE and PBS Office of Facilities Management (OFM) shall perform (and update periodically) climate hazard screening, implement (and update) the climate risk process supporting the Building Assessment Tool (BAT) and Risk Assessment Codes (RAC), and state and update RAC codes for existing facilities.

Background. Lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American interests should not have access to our Nation s secrets, nor should their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts. My Administration must also take appropriate and nec- essary measures to guard against the actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that arise when the Government funds, engages with, or otherwise devotes resources to law firms and their clients that engage in conduct undermining critical American interests and priorities. I have determined that action is necessary to address the significant risks, egregious conduct, and conflicts of interest associated with Susman Godfrey LLP (Susman). Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections. Susman also funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military through the injection of political and radical ideology, and it supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race. Susman itself engages in unlawful discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race. For example, Susman administers a program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities only to  students of color.  My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimi- nation perpetrated in the name of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec. 2. Security Clearance Review. (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applica- ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Susman, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Susman. The heads of agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec. 3. Contracting. (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Susman and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with Susman or with entities that disclose doing business with Susman under subsection (a) of this section. To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall: VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:25 Apr 14, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\15APE0.SGM 15APE0 0 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l 15616 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 71 / Tuesday, April 15, 2025 / Presidential Documents (i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Susman has been hired to perform any service; and (ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Susman or with entities that do business with Susman effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. Sec. 4. Racial Discrimination. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP). Sec. 5. Personnel. (a) The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Susman when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Susman employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States. (b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Susman, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Policy Summary (GSA PBS 1099.1):\nThe policy focuses on safeguarding GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) assets by:\n- Integrating climate risk management into decision-making processes\n- Developing adaptive strategies to manage environmental risks\n- Applying forward-looking science-based climate information\n- Preparing for increased frequency of extreme weather events\n- Ensuring reliable performance of GSA-controlled public assets\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nThe executive order specifically targets Susman Godfrey LLP by:\n- Suspending security clearances for its employees\n- Reviewing and potentially terminating government contracts\n- Limiting official access and interactions with Susman employees\n- Addressing perceived risks of racial discrimination and activities deemed contrary to national interests\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order does NOT directly impact GSA PBS Policy 1099.1. The policy is a climate risk management directive for public buildings, while the executive order is specifically targeting a law firm's interactions with government agencies.\n\nThe policy's core objectives around asset protection, climate resilience, and risk management remain unchanged by this executive order.\n\n4. Compliance Next Steps:\nWhile no direct compliance actions are required, GSA PBS should:\n- Continue implementing the existing climate risk management policy\n- Maintain documentation of policy implementation\n- Ensure ongoing risk assessment processes remain robust\n- Stay informed about any future executive orders that might impact asset management\n\nRecommendation: No immediate policy modifications are necessary based on this executive order.",

As a GSA policy analyst, here is a summary of my findings regarding the potential impact of Executive Order 14263 on GSA Order PBS 1099.1.\n\n***\n\n**TO:** Nina M. Albert, Commissioner, Public Buildings Service\n**FROM:** GSA Policy Analyst\n**DATE:** April 16, 2025\n**SUBJECT:** Analysis of Executive Order 14263 on GSA Order PBS 1099.1, \"Safeguarding Assets\"\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of Executive Order (EO) 14263, \"Addressing Risks From Susman Godfrey,\" and its applicability to GSA Order PBS 1099.1.\n\n### 1. Summary of GSA Order PBS 1099.1 (\"Safeguarding Assets\")\n\nGSA Order PBS 1099.1, issued on January 11, 2023, establishes a formal policy for the Public Buildings Service (PBS) to integrate climate science and risk management into all its core functions. The policy's primary purpose is to safeguard GSA-controlled federal assets against the observed and expected impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. It directs PBS to use forward-looking climate information to inform decisions on portfolio planning, design, construction, operations, and leasing. The Order mandates that PBS offices develop and implement adaptive strategies to ensure the long-term operational and financial stability of its real property portfolio.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order 14263 (\"Addressing Risks From Susman Godfrey\")\n\nExecutive Order 14263, issued on April 9, 2025, directs all executive departments and agencies to take specific actions against the law firm Susman Godfrey LLP. The EO alleges that the firm engages in activities detrimental to American interests, including undermining elections and engaging in unlawful racial discrimination. The EO mandates several actions, including:\n*   Suspending security clearances for individuals at the firm.\n*   Terminating, where permissible, federal contracts with the firm or with other contractors who do business with the firm.\n*   Limiting the firm's employees' access to federal buildings and engagement with government employees.\n*   Restricting the hiring of the firm's employees into federal service.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nAfter a thorough review, I have determined that **Executive Order 14263 does not affect the substance, purpose, or text of GSA Order PBS 1099.1.**\n\nThe two documents operate in entirely separate policy domains.\n\n*   **Subject Matter:** GSA Order PBS 1099.1 is exclusively concerned with the **physical risk to real property assets** resulting from **environmental and climate-related hazards**. Its focus is on facility resilience, infrastructure integrity, and operational continuity in the face of changing weather patterns. The Executive Order is concerned with **counterparty and national security risks** associated with a **specific private entity** (Susman Godfrey LLP). Its focus is on procurement, personnel security, and federal contracting practices.\n\n*   **Required Actions:** The GSA Order requires internal agency actions related to risk assessment, building design standards, and operational planning (e.g., updating the Building Assessment Tool). The Executive Order requires external-facing actions related to a specific law firm: reviewing contracts, security clearances, and building access protocols.\n\nWhile the *policy* of GSA Order PBS 1099.1 is not affected, GSA as an agency will be required to comply with the directives of EO 14263. This compliance, however, falls outside the scope and mandate of the \"Safeguarding Assets\" policy. For example, Section 5(a) of the EO directs agency heads to limit access to federal buildings for Susman Godfrey employees. While PBS is responsible for managing these buildings, the execution of this directive would be a security and operations function, not a modification of the climate risk policy established in PBS 1099.1. The policy on safeguarding a building from flooding is distinct from the operational procedure of denying entry to a specific individual or group.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for GSA Compliance with EO 14263\n\nAlthough no changes are required for GSA Order PBS 1099.1, the agency must take separate steps to ensure compliance with EO 14263. I recommend the following actions be routed to the appropriate GSA offices:\n\n1.  **Office of General Counsel (OGC):** Should immediately review the EO and provide agency-wide guidance on its legal interpretation and implementation, particularly regarding contract termination clauses and personnel actions.\n2.  **Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) & Office of the Chief Acquisition Officer (OCAO):** Must review all current GSA contracts to identify any engagement with Susman Godfrey LLP, either directly or indirectly through other federal contractors. They will need to develop guidance for contracting officers to implement the disclosure and termination requirements outlined in Section 3 of the EO.\n3.  **Office of Mission Assurance (OMA):** In coordination with the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service (FPS), OMA should develop and distribute guidance to facility managers to implement the access restrictions mandated in Section 5 of the EO.\n4.  **Office of Human Resources Management (OHRM):** Must implement the hiring restrictions outlined in Section 5(b) and develop the required waiver process in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nThese compliance activities are operational and procedural and do not necessitate any revision to GSA Order PBS 1099.1.\n\n***\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",

      "phase2_justification": "1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:** GSA Order PBS 1099.1, \"Safeguarding Assets,\" establishes a policy for the Public Buildings Service (PBS) to manage risks to federal buildings and assets. Its domain is exclusively focused on integrating \"risk management and forward-looking science-based climate information\" into all aspects of real property management. The policy's purpose is to prepare for and mitigate the effects of climate change and extreme weather on GSA-controlled properties.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** Executive Order 14263, \"Addressing Risks From Susman Godfrey,\" is a highly targeted directive concerning a single private entity, the law firm Susman Godfrey LLP. Its domain is federal contracting, personnel policy, and national security. The EO instructs federal agencies to suspend security clearances, review and terminate contracts, and limit personnel interactions with this specific firm based on its alleged activities.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** There is no direct or indirect impact on the substance of GSA Order PBS 1099.1.\n    *   **No Direct Impact:** The executive order does not mention the GSA, the Public Buildings Service, asset management, climate change, or environmental risk. The policy does not mention federal contracting with specific entities, security clearances, or personnel restrictions. Their subject matters are entirely unrelated.\n    *   **No Indirect Impact:** The EO establishes a general government-wide restriction on doing business with a specific law firm. While the GSA, in implementing its policies, may enter into contracts for legal or other services, this EO does not alter the *requirements* or *mandates* of the \"Safeguarding Assets\" policy. The GSA must still perform climate hazard screenings, update risk assessment codes, and integrate climate resilience into its projects as stipulated by PBS 1099.1.

      "phase2_response": "Final Decision: [Not Affected]\n\nFull Justification:\n1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy:** GSA Order PBS 1099.1, \"Safeguarding Assets,\" establishes a policy for the Public Buildings Service (PBS) to manage risks to federal buildings and assets. Its domain is exclusively focused on integrating \"risk management and forward-looking science-based climate information\" into all aspects of real property management. The policy's purpose is to prepare for and mitigate the effects of climate change and extreme weather on GSA-controlled properties.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order:** Executive Order 14263, \"Addressing Risks From Susman Godfrey,\" is a highly targeted directive concerning a single private entity, the law firm Susman Godfrey LLP. Its domain is federal contracting, personnel policy, and national security. The EO instructs federal agencies to suspend security clearances, review and terminate contracts, and limit personnel interactions with this specific firm based on its alleged activities.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** There is no direct or indirect impact on the substance of GSA Order PBS 1099.1.\n    *   **No Direct Impact:** The executive order does not mention the GSA, the Public Buildings Service, asset management, climate change, or environmental risk. The policy does not mention federal contracting with specific entities, security clearances, or personnel restrictions. Their subject matters are entirely unrelated.\n    *   **No Indirect Impact:** The EO establishes a general government-wide restriction on doing business with a specific law firm. While the GSA, in implementing its policies, may enter into contracts for legal or other services, this EO does not alter the *requirements* or *mandates* of the \"Safeguarding Assets\" policy. The GSA must still perform climate hazard screenings, update risk assessment codes, and integrate climate resilience into its projects as stipulated by PBS 1099.1.

THOMAS ACTING ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OFFICE OF LEASING (PR) STUART BURNS ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OFFICE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT (PT) Subject: LEASING ALERT (LA-21-06) - Strategic Direction on Lease Terms During and Following the COVID-19 Pandemic This memorandum issues enhanced guidance to PBS offices engaged in planning, negotiating and awarding U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) leases during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance is intended to provide high level guidance on setting lease terms requirements during and following the COVID-19 pandemic and are considering expanding telework. This guidance is in addition to the Leasing Alert issued April 20, 2016 entitled Lease Term Strategy. In March 2020, because of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the Federal Government moved to a mandatory, full-time telework status. Because the Government is still largely in a full-time telework status, many agencies are unsure of their future space requirements. GSA is concerned about a potential surge in short term lease extensions. These short term extensions would result in an anticipated increased cost to the taxpayers, and an associated best manage its workload. U.S. General Services Administration 1800 F Street, NW Washington, DC 20405-0002 www.gsa.gov Therefore, in response to the uncertainty of - term space needs and the potential vacancy risk, GSA is adjusting its suggested approach when determining the length of lease terms. First, GSA must continue to consider how a particular lease transaction aligns with the portfolio strategies of the local market and the customer agency and the degree of financial risk the Public Buildings Service (PBS) is prepared to assume when entering into leases on behalf of a customer agency. Second, the following lease term strategies should be considered: For agencies that submit their long term lease requirements, longer term leases (greater than 10 years) should be considered particularly when the agency requires a specialized facility, to perform their mission critical work (e.g., the judiciary, federal inspection agencies operating at land ports of entry, law enforcement components and those agencies using laboratory spaces). For agencies that submit their short term lease requirements but are still determining their long term space requirements, short term leases (4-6 years) should be considered. This 4-6 year term will allow agencies time to finalize their long term space requirements, while providing GSA time to procure and build out the space. Page 2 of 2",

Policy. American citizens deserve an excellent and efficient Federal workforce that attracts the highest caliber of civil servants committed to achieving the freedom, prosperity, and democratic rule that our Constitution promotes. But current Federal hiring practices are broken, insular, and out- dated. They no longer focus on merit, practical skill, and dedication to our Constitution. Federal hiring should not be based on impermissible factors, such as one s commitment to illegal racial discrimination under the guise of  equity,  or one s commitment to the invented concept of  gender iden- tity  over sex. Inserting such factors into the hiring process subverts the will of the People, puts critical government functions at risk, and risks losing the best-qualified candidates. By making our recruitment and hiring processes more efficient and focused on serving the Nation, we will ensure that the Federal workforce is prepared to help achieve American greatness, and attracts the talent necessary to serve our citizens effectively. By significantly improving hiring principles and practices, Americans will receive the Federal resources and services they deserve from the highest-skilled Federal workforce in the world. Sec. 2. Federal Hiring Plan. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the Administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), shall develop and send to agency heads a Federal Hiring Plan that brings to the Federal workforce only highly skilled Americans dedicated to the furtherance of American ideals, values, and interests. (b) This Federal Hiring Plan shall: (i) prioritize recruitment of individuals committed to improving the effi- ciency of the Federal government, passionate about the ideals of our American republic, and committed to upholding the rule of law and the United States Constitution; (ii) prevent the hiring of individuals based on their race, sex, or religion, and prevent the hiring of individuals who are unwilling to defend the Constitution or to faithfully serve the Executive Branch; (iii) implement, to the greatest extent possible, technical and alternative assessments as required by the Chance to Compete Act of 2024; (iv) decrease government-wide time-to-hire to under 80 days; (v) improve communication with candidates to provide greater clarity regarding application status, timelines, and feedback, including regular updates on the progress of applications and explanations of hiring decisions where appropriate; (vi) integrate modern technology to support the recruitment and selection process, including the use of data analytics to identify trends, gaps, and VerDate Sep<11>2014 18:45 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE9.SGM 30JAE9 5 1 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l 8622 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents opportunities in hiring, as well as leveraging digital platforms to improve candidate engagement; and (vii) ensure Department and Agency leadership, or their designees, are active participants in implementing the new processes and throughout the full hiring process. (c) This Federal Hiring Plan shall include specific agency plans to improve the allocation of Senior Executive Service positions in the Cabinet agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Management and Budget, the Small Business Administration, the Social Security Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration, to best facilitate democratic leadership, as required by law, within each agency. (d) The Federal Hiring Plan shall provide specific best practices for the human resources function in each agency, which each agency head shall implement, with advice and recommendations as appropriate from DOGE. Sec. 3. Accountability and Reporting. (a) The Director of the Office of Per- sonnel Management shall establish clear performance metrics to evaluate the success of these reforms, and request agency analysis on a regular basis. (b) The Office of Personnel Management shall consult with Federal agen- cies, labor organizations, and other stakeholders to monitor progress and ensure that the reforms are meeting the needs of both candidates and agencies. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals; or (iii) the functions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee relating to its conduct of monetary policy.

Summary of Policy Text (Leasing Alert LA-21-06)\n\nLeasing Alert LA-21-06, issued on May 7, 2021, provides strategic guidance to GSA leasing officials on determining lease term lengths in response to the uncertainty of federal agency space requirements following the widespread adoption of telework during the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy aims to mitigate financial risk and manage GSA's workload by avoiding a surge in costly short-term lease extensions. It recommends two primary strategies:\n*   **Longer-term leases (greater than 10 years)** for agencies with defined long-term needs, particularly those requiring specialized facilities.\n*   **Short-term leases (4-6 years)** for agencies still determining their future space needs, allowing them time to finalize plans while GSA prepares for procurement.\n\nIn essence, this policy governs GSA's real estate and portfolio management strategy for leased federal space.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order Text (EO 14170)\n\nExecutive Order 14170, dated January 20, 2025, directs a comprehensive reform of the federal government's hiring and personnel management practices. Its stated goal is to create a more efficient, merit-based hiring process focused on skill and dedication to the U.S. Constitution, while eliminating factors it deems impermissible. The EO mandates the creation of a \"Federal Hiring Plan\" which includes provisions to:\n*   Prioritize recruitment of individuals committed to efficiency and the rule of law.\n*   Decrease the government-wide time-to-hire.\n*   Implement modern technology and technical assessments in recruitment.\n*   Improve the allocation of Senior Executive Service (SES) positions within several agencies, including the General Services Administration (GSA).\n\nIn summary, this Executive Order is exclusively focused on **human resources, personnel policy, and the federal hiring process.**\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Applicability\n\nExecutive Order 14170 **does not apply** to the policies and procedures outlined in Leasing Alert LA-21-06. The two documents operate in entirely separate and distinct domains of federal administration.\n\n*   **Subject Matter:** The Leasing Alert (LA-21-06) is concerned with **real property and asset management**. Its guidance dictates the terms and strategies for leasing physical office space. The Executive Order (EO 14170) is concerned with **human capital and personnel management**. Its directives dictate how federal employees are recruited, assessed, and hired.\n*   **Target Audience and Function:** The Leasing Alert is directed at GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS) personnel responsible for portfolio strategy and lease acquisition. The Executive Order is directed at agency heads and, by extension, their Chief Human Capital Officers and Human Resources (HR) departments. GSA's Office of Human Resources Management (OHRM) would be responsible for implementing the EO's directives, not the Office of Leasing or the Office of Portfolio Management.\n*   **Lack of Direct Influence:** The EO does not contain any language that mandates changes to federal real estate policy, agency space utilization, or telework postures. While a change in hiring philosophy could have very long-term, indirect effects on the size and distribution of the federal workforce, it does not create an immediate requirement to alter the current tactical approach to lease term negotiations. The leasing strategies in LA-21-06 are designed to provide flexibility precisely for such future uncertainties and are therefore not in conflict with the EO.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nAs the policy is not affected by the Executive Order, no compliance actions are necessary for Leasing Alert LA-21-06. The guidance provided in the memorandum remains current and applicable.\n\nThe recommended next steps are as follows:\n1.  Formally document this analysis to confirm that no changes are required for LA-21-06.\n2.  Communicate this determination to the PBS Regional Commissioners and leasing staff to ensure they continue to operate under the existing guidance without confusion.\n3.  Acknowledge that GSA, as an agency, will be significantly affected by EO 14170, and that GSA's OHRM will lead the agency's compliance efforts related to the Federal Hiring Plan mandated by the order. This effort is separate from the real estate functions governed by LA-21-06.\n\n---\n\n**Final Determination: Not Affected**",

      "phase2_justification": "1.  **The specific domain/subject area of the policy**: The policy, GSA Leasing Alert LA-21-06, operates squarely in the domain of **federal real estate portfolio management and leasing strategy**. Its purpose is to provide guidance to GSA personnel on how to structure the length of lease terms (short-term vs. long-term) for federal agencies. The primary driver for this policy is the uncertainty of future office space needs resulting from the widespread adoption of telework during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2.  **The specific domain/subject area of the executive order**: Executive Order 14170 operates in the domain of **federal human resources and civil service reform**. Its exclusive focus is on overhauling the federal hiring process. The order aims to change the criteria for selecting candidates, increase the efficiency of hiring, and ensure new hires align with specific values.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact from the executive order on the policy. The two documents address separate and distinct aspects of government operations.\n    *   **Policy Focus**: The policy is concerned with *physical space* and managing the government's real estate footprint.\n    *   **EO Focus**: The executive order is concerned with *personnel* and the process of bringing new employees into the government.\n\n    The leasing policy is a reaction to a change in *where* federal employees work (i.e., increased telework). The executive order is about *how* and *who* gets hired.

The EO's text is strictly confined to hiring and personnel management and never ventures into real estate, facilities, or workplace strategy.\n\n5.  **Any nuances or edge cases considered in your assessment**: One might argue that Section 2(c) of the EO, which mentions improving the allocation of Senior Executive Service (SES) positions within the General Services Administration (GSA), creates an indirect link. However, this provision affects GSA's internal leadership and management structure, not the substantive content of its existing, outward-facing policies like the Leasing Alert. A change in SES personnel does not automatically alter or rescind established guidance. The leasing policy would remain in effect until it is explicitly modified or superseded by a new directive related to real estate, which this EO is not. Therefore, this connection is too tenuous and speculative to be considered a material impact.",

Purpose and Policy. The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government. The injection of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  (DEI) into our institutions has corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy. Orders to open the borders have endangered the American people and dissolved Federal, State, and local resources that should be used to benefit the American people. Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation. To commence the policies that will make our Nation united, fair, safe, and prosperous again, it is the policy of the United States to restore common sense to the Federal Government and unleash the potential of the American citizen. The revocations within this order will be the first of many steps the United States Federal Government will take to repair our institutions and our economy. Sec. 2. Revocation of Orders and Actions.

      "Summary": "Here's a comprehensive policy analysis:\n\n1. Policy Summary (GSA Order ADM 1100.1):\nThe policy focuses on GSA's response to the climate crisis, specifically:\n- Achieving net zero operational and procurement-related carbon emissions\n- Adapting GSA facilities, operations, and supply chains to withstand climate conditions\n- Implementing Executive Order 14057's sustainability goals, including:\n  * 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030\n  * 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035\n  * Net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045\n  * 65% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030\n\n2. Executive Order Summary (Executive Order 14148):\nThe order systematically revokes numerous previous executive orders, including:\n- Executive Order 14057 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability)\n- Executive Order 14008 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad)\n- Several other climate and sustainability-related executive orders\n\n3. Policy Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order directly impacts GSA Order ADM 1100.1 by:\n- Revoking the foundational Executive Order 14057\n- Effectively nullifying the legal basis for the current climate crisis response policy\n- Signaling a potential complete reversal of previous climate-focused federal policies\n\n4. Recommended Compliance Steps:\n- Immediately pause implementation of current climate sustainability initiatives\n- Await specific guidance from senior leadership\n- Prepare to potentially redesign or suspend the current climate response framework\n- Maintain existing infrastructure and operational capabilities\n- Develop contingency plans for potential policy restructuring\n\nCaveat: As an AI assistant, I recommend that GSA legal and policy teams conduct a thorough, official review of the executive order's implications and provide authoritative guidance.",

      "phase1_response": "TO: GSA Leadership\nFROM: Policy Analysis Division\nDATE: January 28, 2025\nSUBJECT: Impact Analysis of Executive Order 14148 on GSA Order ADM 1100.1\n\nThis memorandum provides an analysis of the newly issued Executive Order 14148 and its direct impact on GSA Order ADM 1100.1, \"Prioritizing GSA Response to the Climate Crisis.\"\n\n### 1. Summary of GSA Order ADM 1100.1\n\nGSA Order ADM 1100.1, signed January 25, 2023, establishes the implementation framework for GSA's response to the climate crisis. Its stated purpose is to guide the agency's activities toward achieving net-zero emissions in operations and procurement, and to adapt GSA assets to withstand current and future climate conditions. The order explicitly states in its \"Background\" section that it is based on the directives of Executive Order 14057, \"Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability,\" and its associated implementation guidance. The specific goals listed in the GSA Order (e.g., 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030, 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035) are taken directly from E.O. 14057.\n\n### 2. Summary of Executive Order 14148\n\nExecutive Order 14148, \"Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions,\" was signed on January 20, 2025. Its stated purpose is to reverse policies of the previous administration that the new administration deems harmful, specifically citing \"Climate extremism\" as a cause of inflation and regulatory burden. The primary function of this Executive Order is to immediately revoke a long list of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and other actions issued between 2021 and 2025. Section 3 of the order directs the heads of agencies to \"take immediate steps to end Federal implementation\" of policies based on the revoked orders.\n\n### 3. Explanation of Applicability\n\nExecutive Order 14148 directly and fundamentally affects GSA Order ADM 1100.1. The connection is explicit and unambiguous.\n\n*   **Direct Revocation of Authority:** Section 2(a) of GSA Order ADM 1100.1 identifies Executive Order 14057 as its primary source of authority and direction.\n*   **Enumerated Rescission:** Section 2(rr) of the new Executive Order 14148 explicitly lists Executive Order 14057 for revocation.\n\nBecause the foundational executive order that GSA Order ADM 1100.1 was created to implement has been revoked, GSA Order ADM 1100.1 has lost its underlying policy and legal basis. Continuing to implement the specific goals and frameworks detailed in GSA Order ADM 1100.1 would be in direct conflict with the directive in Section 3 of E.O. 14148 to \"end Federal implementation\" of the revoked orders.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\n\nTo achieve compliance with Executive Order 14148, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1.  **Immediate Suspension of Implementation:** The Office of the Administrator should issue immediate guidance to all GSA Services and Staff Offices to suspend activities and planning that are solely reliant on the authorities and goals established in GSA Order ADM 1100.1.\n2.  **Consult with the Office of General Counsel (OGC):** OGC should be consulted to provide a formal legal opinion on the status of GSA Order ADM 1100.1 and advise on the proper administrative procedure for its rescission.\n3.  **Initiate Formal Rescission Process:** The Office of the Administrator, as the signatory of the original order, should begin the formal process to rescind GSA Order ADM 1100.1. The order\u2019s status should be changed from \"Active\" to \"Rescinded.\"\n4.  **Review Related Policies and Guidance:** A cross-agency review should be conducted to identify any other GSA policies, procurement guidelines, or internal guidance documents that cite E.O. 14057 or GSA Order ADM 1100.1 as their authority. These documents will also need to be reviewed and amended or rescinded to ensure full compliance.\n5.  **Await New Guidance:** Agency leadership should anticipate further guidance from the White House, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) that aligns with the new administration's policies.\n\n***\n\n**Final Determination: [Affected]**",

One of its stated policy goals is to counter what it terms \"Climate extremism,\" and its primary function is to rescind numerous previous executive orders, many of which relate to climate policy.\n\n3.  **Detailed analysis of whether there is direct or indirect impact:** The impact is direct and substantial.
