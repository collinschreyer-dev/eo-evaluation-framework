      "Policy Text": "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY January 9, 2023 MEMORANDUM FOR ALL FAS ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES FROM: MARK J. LEE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OFFICE OF POLICY AND COMPLIANCE (QV) SUBJECT: Resolving Interagency Policy Differences 1. Purpose. This memorandum defines the consultation process and documentation requirements when resolving interagency policy differences where the Contracting Officer (CO) uses the requesting agency s less restrictive policy. 2. Applicability. This memorandum applies to all FAS activities awarding contracts, Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), or orders via an interagency acquisition. FAR Subpart 2.101 Definitions: Interagency acquisition means a procedure by which an agency needing supplies or services (the requesting agency) obtains them from another agency (the servicing agency) by an assisted acquisition or a direct acquisition. 3. Background. The General Services Administration Manual (GSAM) Subpart 517.5 Interagency Acquisitions clarifies interagency policy differences for interagency acquisitions. The GSAM provides additional guidance on the process of resolving policy differences between GSA and the requesting agency under GSAM Section 517.502(e). 4. Instructions/Procedures. The CO must document their decision process and consult with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) and the FAS Office of Policy and Compliance (OPC), Acquisition Management Division (QVC) (i.e. Service-level acquisition management) when the interagency agreement is unclear on how to resolve interagency policy differences between the requesting agency and GSA. a. For all interagency acquisitions where the CO elects to follow the requesting agency s less restrictive policy (e.g., higher dollar authority, streamlined procedures); the CO must prepare a  Memorandum for Record  similar to Attachment A. b. The memo must include the:   proposed requesting agency s less restrictive policy and the source of the policy (e.g., statute, regulation, internal agency guidance), 1 DocuSign Envelope ID: 5FBCC267-B3F3-47B7-87EE-84A5C8E1E3F6   OGC confirmation that GSA has the authority to utilize the less restrictive policy, and   the management controls the CO will use to manage the Government s risk. c. For FAS OPC/QVC consultation requests; the CO must submit the completed Memorandum for Record with evidence of OGC consultation to: documentreview-fasqv@gsa.gov. When the FAS OPC consultation is complete and the Memorandum of Record is approved, the FAS OPC/QVC Director will return it to the CO. d. At a minimum, the memo should include the following signatures/approvals:   CO   One level above the CO   OGC (e.g. Assistant Regional Counsel)   FAS OPC/QVC Director e. After the memo is approved, it should be filed in Tab 3 (Acquisition Strategy) or Tab 28 (Required Approval/Clearance) of the electronic contract file, according to the FAS Contract File Standards PAP 2020-04. f. As applicable, an Acquisition Review Briefing (ARB) may be required in accordance with GSAM Section 504.7104. NOTE: Attention should be given to the source of each agency s policy. Statutes (including National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA)) and regulations (including the FAR, DFARS and GSAR) carry higher authority than such instruments as a GSA Acquisition Letter (AL), a FAS Procurement Information Notice (PIN), or a DoD Procedures, Guidance and Information (PGI). A CO may not choose the client s less restrictive policy to deviate from a provision in the FAR or GSAR. 5. Effective Date. January 9, 2023. 2 DocuSign Envelope ID: 5FBCC267-B3F3-47B7-87EE-84A5C8E1E3F6 6. Signature. _______________________________ Mark J.

Purpose and Policy. The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government. The injection of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  (DEI) into our institutions has corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy. Orders to open the borders have endangered the American people and dissolved Federal, State, and local resources that should be used to benefit the American people. Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation. To commence the policies that will make our Nation united, fair, safe, and prosperous again, it is the policy of the United States to restore common sense to the Federal Government and unleash the potential of the American citizen. The revocations within this order will be the first of many steps the United States Federal Government will take to repair our institutions and our economy. Sec. 2. Revocation of Orders and Actions.

      "Summary": "Here's a comprehensive policy analysis:\n\n1. Policy Summary:\nThe document is a GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) memorandum dated January 9, 2023, specifically addressing procedures for resolving interagency policy differences during acquisitions. It provides detailed guidance for Contracting Officers (COs) on documenting and consulting when using a requesting agency's less restrictive policy in interagency acquisitions.\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nThis is a broad executive order dated January 20, 2025, focused on rescinding numerous previous executive orders, with a particular emphasis on reducing what the document describes as \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) practices across federal agencies.\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order does NOT directly impact this specific GSA interagency acquisition policy. The policy provides procedural guidance for resolving policy differences between agencies, which is a technical administrative process unrelated to the broader policy themes in the executive order.\n\nKey reasons for non-applicability:\n- The policy is a technical procedural document about acquisition processes\n- It does not explicitly implement any DEI-related practices\n- The policy focuses on administrative consultation and documentation\n- The executive order targets broader policy implementations, not specific administrative procedures\n\n4. Recommended Compliance Steps:\nWhile no direct action is required, the GSA may want to:\n- Review the policy to ensure continued compliance with federal acquisition regulations\n- Confirm that the consultation process remains transparent and legally sound\n- Maintain existing documentation requirements\n- Continue following standard interagency acquisition protocols\n\nRecommendation: No immediate changes are necessary to this policy based on the executive order.\n\nCaveat: This analysis is based on a careful review of the documents and represents a professional interpretation. For definitive guidance, consult GSA's Office of General Counsel.",

      "phase1_response": "## Policy Analysis Summary\n\n### 1. Brief Summary of the Policy Text\nThe GSA memorandum from January 9, 2023, establishes procedures for resolving interagency policy differences in acquisitions. It requires Contracting Officers to document their decision-making process and consult with the Office of General Counsel and FAS Office of Policy and Compliance when adopting a requesting agency's less restrictive procurement policies. The memo mandates preparation of a \"Memorandum for Record\" when following less restrictive policies from other agencies, including documentation of the policy source and justification.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of the Executive Order Text\nExecutive Order 14148, issued January 20, 2025, aims to rescind what it characterizes as \"harmful\" policies from the previous administration. The order specifically targets diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, border policies, and climate-related regulations. Section 2 revokes several executive orders from January 20, 2021, including those related to racial equity, census enumeration, and COVID-19 response coordination.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability\nThis executive order **does not apply** to the GSA acquisition policy memorandum for the following reasons:\n\n**Scope Mismatch**: The executive order specifically targets DEI policies, immigration/border policies, and climate regulations. The GSA memorandum addresses procedural requirements for interagency acquisition coordination and policy conflict resolution.\n\n**Subject Matter Difference**: The GSA policy is purely administrative and procedural, focusing on:\n- Documentation requirements for contracting decisions\n- Consultation processes with legal counsel\n- Interagency coordination procedures\n- Acquisition management protocols\n\n**No DEI/Climate/Immigration Content**: The acquisition policy contains no references to diversity, equity, inclusion, climate change, or immigration matters that would fall under the executive order's scope.\n\n**Administrative vs. Substantive Policy**: The GSA memorandum establishes process controls rather than substantive policy positions that would conflict with the executive order's stated objectives.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\nNo compliance actions are required because the policy is not affected by the executive order. The GSA should:\n\n- Continue implementing the existing acquisition consultation procedures\n- Monitor for any future executive orders that might specifically address acquisition policies\n- Maintain current documentation and consultation requirements\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

      "phase2_justification": "**\n\n1. **Policy Subject Area**: Federal acquisition management - specifically the procedural framework for resolving interagency policy differences in contracting activities, including consultation processes and documentation requirements.\n\n2. **Executive Order Subject Area**: Rescission of specific substantive federal policies related to DEI programs, border/immigration policies, and climate regulations across federal agencies.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact because:\n   - The memorandum establishes a **procedural framework** that is content-neutral\n   - The EO targets **specific substantive policy areas** (DEI, immigration, climate) that are not addressed in the acquisition memorandum\n   - The consultation and documentation processes described wo",
      "phase2_response": "**Step 1: Policy Domain Identification**\nThe FAS Memorandum addresses **federal procurement and acquisition policy**, specifically focusing on interagency acquisition procedures, contracting officer authorities, policy consultation processes, and documentation requirements when resolving differences between agency policies.\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain Identification**\nExecutive Order 14148 addresses **broad federal policy rescissions** across multiple domains, with primary focus on eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, border policies, and climate-related regulations from federal agencies and operations.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nThese domains operate in different spheres of federal administration:\n- The policy deals with **procedural aspects** of how agencies coordinate and resolve policy differences in acquisition activities\n- The executive order targets **substantive policy areas** (DEI, immigration, climate) for elimination\n\nThe procedural framework for resolving interagency policy differences would remain functionally relevant regardless of which substantive policies are being coordinated between agencies.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment**\nWhile the initial flag indicates \"Not Affected,\" I must consider whether the executive order's broad rescission authority and emphasis on eliminating \"radical practices within every agency\" could extend to acquisition procedures. However, the memorandum establishes a neutral administrative process rather than promoting any specific substantive policies that the EO targets.\n\n**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Subject Area**: Federal acquisition management - specifically the procedural framework for resolving interagency policy differences in contracting activities, including consultation processes and documentation requirements.\n\n2. **Executive Order Subject Area**: Rescission of specific substantive federal policies related to DEI programs, border/immigration policies, and climate regulations across federal agencies.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact because:\n   - The memorandum establishes a **procedural framework** that is content-neutral\n   - The EO targets **specific substantive policy areas** (DEI, immigration, climate) that are not addressed in the acquisition memorandum\n   - The consultation and documentation processes described would continue to be necessary regardless of which substantive policies agencies are coordinating\n   - No language in the EO suggests elimination of interagency coordination procedures in acquisition activities\n\n4. **Supporting Language**: The EO's focus on \"diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" \"orders to open the borders,\" and \"climate extremism\" does not intersect with the memorandum's focus on \"consultation process and documentation requirements when resolving interagency policy differences\" in acquisition contexts.\n\n5. **Edge Cases Considered**: While the EO has broad language about \"radical practices within every agency,\" the specific procedural nature of interagency acquisition coordination falls outside the targeted substantive policy domains.

Brief Summary of the Policy Text\n\nGSA Order ADM 1100.1 \"Prioritizing GSA Response to the Climate Crisis\" (effective January 25, 2023 - January 25, 2030) establishes an implementation framework for GSA's climate response efforts. The policy aims to achieve net zero operational and procurement-related carbon emissions while adapting GSA facilities, operations, and supply chains to climate conditions. It references Executive Order 14057 and outlines specific federal sustainability goals including 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030, 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035, net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045, and a 65% reduction in scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of the Executive Order Text\n\nThe executive order (Proclamation 10885, January 20, 2025) addresses flag protocols for Inauguration Day. It directs that the U.S. flag be flown at full-staff on all current and future Inauguration Days at the White House, public buildings, military installations, and U.S. facilities worldwide. After Inauguration Day ends, the flag returns to half-staff to honor former President Jimmy Carter until 30 days after his death have concluded, as previously directed by Proclamation 10876.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Application\n\nThis executive order does not apply to GSA's climate crisis response policy. The executive order is purely ceremonial, addressing flag display protocols for a specific commemorative occasion (Inauguration Day) and temporary mourning period. It contains no provisions related to:\n- Environmental policy\n- Climate change initiatives\n- Federal sustainability goals\n- Building operations\n- Procurement practices\n- Carbon emissions reduction\n- Any operational aspects covered by ADM 1100.1\n\nThe subject matters are entirely unrelated - one focuses on comprehensive climate action implementation, while the other addresses patriotic flag display protocols.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\n\nNo compliance actions are required as the executive order does not affect the climate crisis response policy. GSA should continue implementing ADM 1100.1 as established, pursuing the outlined climate goals and sustainability measures without modification based on this executive order.\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

The Executive Order's flag display requirements do not alter, modify, or interfere with any aspect of GSA's climate crisis response framework, including:\n   - Carbon emission reduction targets\n   - Procurement sustainability requirements\n   - Facility adaptation measures\n   - Supply chain resilience planning\n\n4. **Key Language Supporting Determin",
      "phase2_response": "**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**\nThe policy \"1100.1ADM, Prioritizing GSA Response to the Climate Crisis\" falls within the environmental policy and federal sustainability domain. It specifically focuses on:\n- Achieving net-zero operational and procurement-related carbon emissions\n- Climate adaptation for GSA facilities, operations, and supply chains\n- Implementation of Executive Order 14057 regarding federal sustainability\n- Climate crisis response measures\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**\nThe Executive Order \"Flying The Flag Of The United States At Full-Staff On Inauguration Day\" (Proclamation 10885) falls within the ceremonial/symbolic governance domain. It specifically addresses:\n- Flag display protocols for Inauguration Day\n- Ceremonial procedures for federal buildings and military installations\n- Symbolic representation of national values\n- Administrative protocol for flag positioning\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nThese two documents operate in completely distinct policy domains:\n- The GSA policy addresses substantive environmental and operational concerns related to climate change mitigation and adaptation\n- The Executive Order addresses ceremonial flag display procedures for a specific national observance\n\nThere is no logical connection between flag display protocols and climate crisis response activities. The Executive Order does not contain any provisions that would modify, supersede, or influence GSA's climate-related operations, procurement decisions, facility adaptations, or carbon emission reduction efforts.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment Context**\nThe phase1_flag of \"Not Affected\" aligns with the substantive analysis. Both documents serve entirely different governmental functions with no operational overlap.\n\n**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: The GSA policy operates in the environmental sustainability and climate response domain, focusing on operational changes to achieve carbon neutrality and climate resilience.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: The Executive Order operates in the ceremonial/protocol domain, establishing symbolic flag display requirements for Inauguration Day.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact between these domains. The Executive Order's flag display requirements do not alter, modify, or interfere with any aspect of GSA's climate crisis response framework, including:\n   - Carbon emission reduction targets\n   - Procurement sustainability requirements\n   - Facility adaptation measures\n   - Supply chain resilience planning\n\n4. **Key Language Supporting Determination**: The Executive Order is explicitly limited to flag display \"at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels\" for ceremonial purposes. It contains no language affecting environmental policies, operational procedures, or climate-related activities.\n\n5. **Nuances Considered**: While both documents may technically apply to federal facilities, they address completely separate operational aspects - one ceremonial, one substantive environmental policy. The ceremonial flag requirement does not create any conflict with or modification to climate response activities. This is a clear case of non-intersecting policy domains where both can be implemented simultaneously without any interaction.",

Since 1994, the DE Program has overseen GSA s commitment to expert-informed decision making, ensuring that the agency s investments incorporate best practices in building performance, community engagement, project management, and myriad other categories. DE s comprehensive approach to delivering best customer value has consistently achieved superior quality on time, on budget, and within scope. Following on, the successful integration of the DE Program in federally owned new construction and major modernizations, in 2001 GSA extended the DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 2 of 22 program s policies and procedures to certain lease acquisitions involving new building construction. The agency launched the Design Excellence in Leasing Program (DE-Leasing) and published an accompanying Design Excellence in Leasing Guide. This Design Excellence in Leasing Program Guidance (DEL-PG) updates and replaces the 2001 Design Excellence in Leasing Guide. It provides a framework for applying DE to certain lease procurements specifically Lease Construction, which is described as new building construction lease acquisitions where the Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) mandates new building construction. Lease Construction is fully defined in Chapter 14 of the PBS Leasing Desk Guide (LDG). The DEL-PG outlines the up to date best practices for integrating DE methods into qualifying projects  delivery. This guidance identifies program strategies and resources that maximize a project s benefits from its outset. It also shows how to engage agency customers and other stakeholders in a productive project dialogue, because good design welcomes maximum collaboration-which in turn fosters innovation. Guidance highlights include:     An overall process for incorporating DE into lease acquisitions involving new building construction (i.e., Lease Construction as described in this document). Information concerning project requirements and kickoff meetings, which support the definition of a project and its team members  roles.   Procedures for assembling and utilizing design reviewers effectively.   Strategies for overseeing and championing design quality pre- and -post lease award. PROGRAM OVERVIEW - 1 GSA s DE-Leasing program establishes nationwide policies and procedures for selecting the most suitable design teams for Lease Construction projects. The DE-Leasing process of reviewing submissions from offerors and their associated Architect/Engineer (A/E) firms and their lead designers ensures that projects utilize the design services of high-quality design teams. The program is also dedicated to facilitating those teams  best work:   Establishing milestones when key collaborators can synchronize DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 3 of 22 project understanding and coordinate tasks.   Means and methods for producing high-quality, high-performance facilities.   Assuring that architecture, urban design, landscape architecture, interior design, engineering, historic preservation, construction, security, sustainability, and workplace design knowledge of the Office of the Chief Architect - based Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) is appropriately integrated.   Facilitating collaboration between the leasing community and Chief Architects or designee, so that applicable leasing projects embrace a culture of quality design.   Should a region encounter Market Driven construction, first consult with the Office of Leasing for further guidance DE-Leasing shall be included in leases for lease construction as outlined more thoroughly in LDG Chapter 14. While Lease Construction represents a small percentage of GSA s lease acquisitions, there are instances when lease construction best meets customer needs. In turn, DE-Leasing creates a platform for GSA s Chief Architect or designee, SMEs, PMs, Leasing Contracting Officers (LCOs), and Leasing Specialists (LSs) to share best practices and uncover opportunities for maximizing taxpayer value. The program is a commitment to providing customer agencies with fiscally and environmentally responsible space, which creates a positive impression of the Federal Government. This DEL-PG instructs the project manager (PM) or Leasing Specialist (LS) to work with the Chief Architect) or designee to develop project specific DE requirements, as necessary. The Chief Architect or designee, will work with the project team to integrate DE principles into Lease Construction projects utilizing existing program resources and coordinate with the Chief Architect or designee as necessary. Irrespective of size or type, all Lease Construction projects require Chief Architect or designee guidance from their inception. As soon as Lease Construction has been determined, the Chief Architect or designee must be contacted by the PM and included as members of the leasing project team. The Chief Architect or designee membership in the project team ensures that a project appropriately integrates proven strategies for design quality. The Office of the Chief Architect, the Office of Leasing, the Office of Portfolio Management, and related programs collaborate regularly to deliver the best value for the American taxpayer. By articulating the partnership between the Chief Architect or designee and the leasing project team, this DEL-PG maximizes participation among all in-house experts and key stakeholders. DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 4 of 22 Department of Transportation Headquarters, Washington DC PROJECT PLANNING - 2 This section articulates the components of GSA s DE-Leasing process for Lease Construction. While modifications and adjustments of the process are permissible to address local/regional practices and procedures as necessary, DE- Leasing essentially comprises four steps:   Needs Assessment and Requirements Development   Develop and issue the RLP, including source selection criteria   Review and evaluate design submittals   Post-award design evaluation NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPMENT FOR LEASE CONSTRUCTION ONLY Before commencing the project, all key stakeholders must have a thorough is best understanding of the agency s needs and requirements. This accomplished with clear requirements that may information concerning agency goals and objectives, staff and support space, adjacency needs, workspace standards and allocations, and technical room and space requirements. At a minimum, the PM should discuss these issues with the customer agency and the LCO, who thereafter must identify the requirements include DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 5 of 22 within the RLP. For Lease Construction projects, PMs should reach out to the Chief Architect or designee for guidance in determining the applicability of DE-Leasing. Preferably, the entire project team should also convene a kickoff session to clarify the following elements of design integration:   Goals and vision   Community visibility and importance   Design opportunities and criteria   Agency needs and requirements   Budget and schedule   Roles and responsibilities of the project team   Schedule and time constraints   Existing market options and opportunities NEXT STEPS Many opportunities to improve design and construction quality arise during a project s needs assessment phase and beyond. Leasing project teams should work with the Chief Architect or designee to identify different points along the lease acquisition timeline to leverage resources and maximize a project s potential. The Chief Architect or designee tailor quality assurance opportunities to the project s building type, scope, and budget while focusing on the following milestones. Advertisement - When lease construction is the known course of action, engagement with the Chief Architect or designee during this phase facilitates proper inclusion of potential DE-Leasing language in advertisements posted on BetaSAM/SAM or alternative Governmentwide point of entry (GPEs) and similar resources. Determining Approach - DE-Leasing creates collaboration between DE- Leasing representatives and the leasing project team for Lease Construction. For these projects, the Chief Architect or designee shall provide technical input and guidance in the development of DE-Leasing Source Selection evaluation factors for the RLP, Lease, and any associated documents to support an award determination. The Chief Architect or designee participates in design evaluations and, depending upon project complexity, the Chief Architect or designee may nominate staff experts, and Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) A/E contractors to act as technical advisors to the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB). (See LDG Chapter 2, LDG Chapter 13, and LDG Chapter 14). Requirements Development - GSA s successful delivery of space depends on DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 6 of 22 shared understanding of customer requirements. The process of identifying a customer agency s strategic, functional, and technical requirements is the first step in agency delivery. Note that, while some customer agencies may have well established, highly developed requirements, others may have a Program of Requirements (POR) that requires GSA validation. DE-Leasing should also be discussed with the customer agency during this phase, and in applicable cases the PM should consult with the Chief Architect or designee to gather the strategic and technical requirements. Requirements Package   The requirements package is typically a compilation of several separate documents, forms, or other attachments that contain the detailed information necessary to produce a well crafted RLP and executed lease. The package details the DE-Leasing features and processes specific to a project. Further, it is important to understand the distinction between an agency s special requirements versus its preferences, which could be used as award factors in the procurement (e.g., 50-foot building setback required versus a 200-foot setback requested). (See the LDG for more information.) Post Award Kick-off Meeting- After award, GSA will meet with the Lessor s A/E and lead designer to convey the basis of design as outlined in the RLP. Design Intent Drawings (DID) - As a member of the leasing project team, the Chief Architect or designee provides input and guidance during the DID phase for any Lease Construction project. Design Phases - The Chief Architect or designee (or appropriate designee) participates in reviews of the following activities: schematic design; design development, and final design phases. DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 7 of 22 EPA Potomac Yards One, Arlington, VA DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 8 of 22 LEASING POLICY & GUIDANCE IMPACTING DESIGN - 3 THE LEASING DESK GUIDE (LDG) The LDG is the primary policy and lease acquisition guidance reference for real property lease acquisitions. It contains authorities, policies, technical and procedural guidance and administrative limitations governing lease acquisition. Office of Leasing professionals follow policies as they are updated or canceled via LDG revisions, Leasing Alerts, or Lease Acquisition Circulars. The LDG provides DE-Leasing guidance in the following chapters:   Chapter 1 - Requirements Development   Chapter 2 - New or Replacing Lease Acquisitions   Chapter 13 - Source Selection in Leasing   Chapter 14 - Lease Acquisitions Involving New Building Construction (Otherwise referred to as Lease Construction) As first noted in Section 1 of this document, DE-Leasing must be applied whenever the RLP specifies Lease Construction. RLPs for Lease Construction must also allow Best Value Tradeoff (BVTO); DE-Leasing is not intended for RLPs that employ a lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection. NEW BUILDING/LEASE CONSTRUCTION IN LEASING Due to the various complexities inherent to lease construction, detailed guidance ensures proper implementation of policies and processes for all scenarios. The Chief Architect or designee should familiarize themselves with the LDG, while all DE-Leasing stakeholders should understand the following leasing definitions, key terms, and concepts at a minimum. Lease Construction is more thoroughly defined in LDG Chapter-14. Lease Construction is a leasing solution when the Government mandates that only new building construction can meet its technical requirements. Such mandates are rare, issued typically when the existing market lacks highly unique (specialized) space. Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service (PBS-P100) establishes design standards and criteria for Lease Construction facilities, but only when GSA s formal RLP includes a purchase option for GSA to acquire the building at a future date determined jointly by the Office of the Chief Architect and the Office of Leasing. (See LDG Chapter-14 to learn about purchase options in detail). DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 9 of 22 RLP & LEASE CONTENT In cases of Lease Construction where DE-Leasing is incorporated, the LCO will work with the Chief Architect or designee to develop source selection evaluation factors and criteria and to review technical requirements as necessary. The RLP package includes the source selection factors and minimum requirements for lease negotiation. The RLP must describe expectations and scope that inform offerors of what to include in their proposal, as well as the factors by which proposals will be evaluated. Drafting the RLP is a critical part of any lease procurement. The process of drafting an RLP package for Lease Construction projects contains complexities discussed in the LDG. The current version of the RLP and lease documents are available on the National Office of Leasing Google site and on GSA.gov. If DE- Leasing is used, then the RLP source selection methodology must be written for a BVTO. SOURCE SELECTION The term source selection refers to selecting a source or sources as outlined in Part 570 of the General Services Administration Acquisition Manual. Source selection includes both the LPTA and BVTO processes. For additional information on source selection in leasing, refer to LDG Chapters 2, 13, and 14. If BVTO is used for a lease project that involves DE-Leasing, then there are two methods typically attributable to this process:   Single Phase - BVTO   Two Phase Design Build - BVTO Both are appropriate when an award to other than the lowest price offeror, or to the highest technically rated offeror, is the best option for the government. SINGLE PHASE - BVTO BVTO prioritizes design and designer qualifications in source selection. While it can be applied to all procurements, it should be used when technical factors are equal to or more important than price. This approach allows the Federal Government to specify certain award factors to evaluate offers beyond simply determining whether they meet the RLP s requirements; an award may be made to an offer that is higher than the lowest priced offer when that offer provides substantially more value to the Government based on the stated evaluation criteria. Single Phase BVTO employs technical award factors, with the relative ranking DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 10 of 22 and weights to help determine the successful awardee. Past performance and price must be included as award factors. The importance of the overall technical proposal to price must also be determined (e.g., substantially greater than, approximately equal to, or substantially less than price) prior to issuance of the RLP. Based on this methodology, the RLP must require offerors  design team qualifications to be submitted for review and evaluation, specifying a level of past performance information commensurate with the size, cost, and function of the procurement. The RLP may also require the initial offer submission to include interior and exterior elevations and perspectives, as well as documentation of site conditions, building positioning, views, open space information, access, setbacks, landscape design, and other important design considerations. TWO PHASE DESIGN BUILD Two-Phase Design Build BVTO is the tradeoff method that should be used when the leasing project team knows that the project will require new building construction and when customer agency requirements are well defined. It incorporates a high level of requirements for site and facility design and for the qualifications of the A/E and lead designer. Two Phase Design Build BVTO applies to lease construction that is anticipated to have a significant presence. Significant presence is associated with buildings that occupy prominent locations, that generate a high level of public traffic, and which are considered politically sensitive or highly visible. The nature of the project s surroundings can also create a significant presence. This is the case with border installations or any project that makes the building the only federally leased building, or one of few federally leased buildings, in the area. Two Phase Design Build BVTO is also appropriate in cases where the Federal Government acquires or works with a developer to acquire a site. The RLP should require the first-phase submission to include the offerors  design team qualifications (A/E firm as well as lead designer s qualifications), the offeror and design team s past performance, and site and building orientation (identifying both ingress and egress to the site). The second phase submission should include both interior and exterior elevations and perspectives, as well as documentation on site conditions, building positioning, views, open space information, access, setbacks, landscaping and other important design features. (At a minimum, interior elevations must depict common areas that include public lobby, elevator lobbies, and other spaces that include, but are not limited to, stacked infrastructural rooms. Offerors must also include other interior drawings that include, but are not limited to, a typical floor plan, typical office layout, roof plan, etc. These determinations will be made by the leasing project team in close collaboration with the Chief Architect or designee.) DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 11 of 22 The Chief Architect or designee plays a significant role in the development of the design criteria and technical evaluation factors for lease construction source selection. The Chief Architect or designee may be a voting member of the SSEB, and the Chief Architect or designee are available to offer guidance to the LCO. The SSEB will evaluate site and facility designs. The Source Selection Plan (SSP) provides guidance for developing the RLP, identifying evaluation factors and methods used in evaluating proposals. The LCO works with the leasing project team to develop the SSP and receives technical assistance from the SSEB in such development. The SSEB should review the SSP before the presolicitation conference and before RLP issuance. FEMA Headquarters, Winchester, VA DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 12 of 22 SOURCE SELECTION IN FURTHER DETAIL - 4 After the determination of a Single Phase BVTO or Two- Phase Design Build BVTO for procurement, the Chief Architect or designee shall work with the LCO to develop evaluation factors and design requirements for the RLP and SSP. EVALUATION FACTORS AND REQUIREMENTS Evaluation factors may include, but are not limited to site, design, and offeror/team qualifications. The RLP will define the minimum requirements for each evaluation factor. In addition to the minimum RLP requirements, important evaluation factors affecting the building design need to be evaluated. These may include:   How the site supports program requirements (i.e., capacity, expansion)   Zoning and anticipated usage.   Site ownership and/or control.   Environmental and regulatory compliance.   A/E firm and lead designer s completion of projects of similar size and complexity.   Capacity of surrounding infrastructure, e.g., transportation, roads, utilities.   Surrounding amenities, e.g., shops, childcare, food service, hospitality, etc.   Ability of the facility s design and layout to support customer s operational requirements.   Other minimum requirements as stated in the RLP. Design requirements are typically tailored to the needs of the project. They are based on the level of design required pre- or post-award and extent of designer qualifications. A/E FIRM AND LEAD DESIGNER S QUALIFICATIONS An offeror s entire design team must demonstrate its ability to satisfy the comprehensive project development and management requirements of the RLP. The qualifications information submitted by offerors can be basic or extensive; such breadth depends on the level and complexity of the project. This information encompasses both experience and past performance. Experience refers to offeror-submitted information about completed projects, whereas past performance is gathered via checks of references provided by the offeror on how well those projects were completed. DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 13 of 22 Commented [2]: correct formatting Design Philosophy and Approach of the lead designer is one other factor to be evaluated as part of the RLP process. Evaluation of design philosophy and approach may include, but are not limited the following elements:   Understanding of the Government s requirements.   Demonstration of creativity and innovation in meeting those requirements.   Balancing design with budget limitations.   Integration of the site and surrounding environment.   Application of current sustainability and energy-efficiency requirements. Evaluation of the lead designer s experience, includes, but is not limited to: successful completion of at least three projects similar in size, complexity, and scope in the last 10 years. Evaluation of Past Performance is based on reference checks of the offeror and key personnel (i.e. the A/E and Lead Designer) when requested although there are cases in which SSEBs have specified reference checks for entities such as the offeror s project manager and general contractor. Past performance reference checks are not a guarantee of future design quality. The past performance should evaluate the design portfolio of the A/E firm and lead designer in terms of:   Cost control   Timeliness of performance   Business relations   Technical quality of the service performed   Small business subcontracting DESIGN SUBMITTAL REVIEW AND EVALUATION SSEB s typically evaluates A/E and lead designer s qualifications, as well as design teams , site and design analyses. In addition, design evaluation criteria are identified, defined, and communicated to offerors in the RLP. Examples of design evaluation criteria may include:   Ease of accessibility (e.g., curb cuts, condition of route).   Weather protection (covered and climate-controlled areas).   Visual and physical security.   Building efficiency (RU factor).   Floor plate efficiency (RU factor).   Building form supports the function of the tenant agency, (e.g., space allocations reflect the documented needs of occupants).   Building form expresses the mission and goals of the tenant agency. DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 14 of 22   Workspace quality: team areas, open/closed offices.   Finished ceiling height in feet.

Commented [3]: fix bullet   Percent of floor plate that is no more than 50 feet from natural light source.   Lease span depth in feet.   Sustainability POST-AWARD DESIGN ACTIVITIES Depending on the procurement method used, the level of design completed prior to lease award varies significantly. Defining the post-award design process and other design activities is therefore a fundamental task of a leasing project team. The team s description must encompass design, construction documents, and construction/refurbishment. It must also specify the number and type of design reviews, topics, and designated decision makers, along with specific outcomes and objectives of each review session. The input of the team s Chief Architect or designee is fundamental to this effort. After a lease award, the PM should conduct a Post Award Kickoff meeting with the successful offeror to define the roles, scope, and authority for the project s design process. The customer agency must be present at this meeting, while the offeror s representatives, PM, LCO, PBS Office of Facility Management representative, Chief Architect or designee, and any other necessary participants should attend, as well. The Chief Architect or designee shall continue to play a significant role in the design process after lease award, because achieving a successful, well-designed building is an ongoing process. Management of the detailed design, construction, build-out, and occupancy of the new leased space should abide by the terms that the leasing project team defines in the RLP and Lease Agreement.

When it is known that Lease Construction will be the approved lease acquisition direction, the PM or LCO will engage the Chief Architect or designee as a member of the project team. The project team also includes the LS and subject matter experts representing architecture, engineering, interior design and other subject matter experts as necessary. The Office of Leasing assists federal agencies in accomplishing their mission by providing lease acquisition services that deliver space on time, at the best value, and with superior solutions. The Regional Leasing Office determines the project lead for a Lease Construction project. The designated project lead (the PM, LCO, or LS) will engage the Chief Architect or designee on all new building construction lease projects. Project Managers (PMs) oversee management of the most complex projects. They have overall project-management responsibility for assigned projects from preliminary identification through initiation, planning, execution, and project- closeout stages. The PM s broad managerial responsibilities encompass planning and requirements development, as well as organizing, controlling, coordinating, reviewing, and approving design, construction, project delivery, and related work. The PM shepherds a project to implementation, and serves as a key resource during all stages of execution. If there is a PM assigned to a project, then the LCO becomes a team member on the leasing project team. Whether the PM or LCO serves as the project lead, that person must contact the Chief Architect or designee early in a Lease Construction project s development process. The Leasing Contracting Officer (LCO) has exclusive authority to enter into, amend, and administer leases on the Government s behalf to the extent provided in his or her certificate of appointment as a contracting officer. The LCO safeguards the interests of the United States in its lease acquisition program, processes, and policies. The Leasing Specialist (LS) assists the LCO and may perform duties that do not legally obligate the Government. GSA has established guidelines regarding the issues that a LS must consider when allocating resources to support the design, construction, and project management phases of projects (e.g., size, complexity, availability of local GSA associates, and/or IDIQ DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 17 of 22 contractors). The Office of Design and Construction, which includes the Office of the Chief Architect and the Office of Project Delivery, provides national leadership in design and construction expertise. in architecture, engineering, and construction project management support GSA s regional offices coordinating policies, procedures, initiatives, and sharing best practices. Its trusted experts The Chief Architect, in coordination with Regional Chief Architects (RCA s) and DE-Leasing National Program Director, oversees GSA's implementation of the national DE Program and partners with the Office of Leasing concerning implementation of DE-Leasing. The Chief Architect represents agency-wide standards of quality through multiple programs that include DE. The DE-Leasing National Program Director (DE-LNPD) is the Central Office- based Design Excellence point of contact to the GSA regions through the RCA s. The DE-LNPD ensures that GSA s national design policy is applied to regional projects. The DE-LNPD supports the integration of DE-Leasing into projects. Depending upon project complexity, the DE-LNPD may offer suggestions for Central Office SMEs to act as advisors to the SSEB. The DE-LNPD is a key resource in the design approach. The DE-LNPD, upon RCA request, may also contribute to requirements development and any post award design issues that may arise. Regional Chief Architect s (RCA) are the DE point of contact to the GSA Regions. The RCA ensures that GSA s national design policy is applied to regional projects, by engaging with Lease Construction projects from initial scoping and kickoff through the design development phase and/or early construction documents. The RCA may be designated as a project team member for all Lease Construction projects in their specific region. The RCA supports the integration of DE-Leasing into projects by: providing design submittal criteria for the LCO to use in the evaluation factors; reviewing proposed RLP content related to design and participating in design submittal evaluations. Depending upon project complexity, the RCA may offer suggestions for Regional SME s to act as advisors to the SSEB. RCA s are a key resource in procurement and design approach for A/E selection and design review. RCA involvement may not be limited to the project s initial design phase. These team members may also contribute to requirements development and any post award design issues that may arise. Subject Matter Experts (SME s) provide expertise that helps define customer agency requirements and facilitates projects. They may also participate in DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 18 of 22 market surveys, reviews of tenant improvement (TI) costs, design, build-outs, and construction inspections in summary, these GSA staff experts draw on their specialized knowledge to assist the whole lease acquisition process. SMEs  knowledge areas include, but are not limited to accessibility, DE-Leasing policies and procedures, engineering, fire and life safety, historic preservation, sustainability, and workplace design. Regional Workplace Executives (RWE s) are another resource internal to GSA, as they work in concert with the Chief Architect or designee to support the leasing project team as necessary. RWE specialties include interior space design, procurement approach, DID (design intent drawings), and design review for TIs. RWEs partner with stakeholders to create customized workplace programs, which focus on mobile strategies and flexible environments that help agencies meet their business, sustainability, and real estate goals. NOAA Center for Weather Prediction, Riverdale, MD DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 19 of 22 APPENDIX   2 DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE TO DE- LEASING Acquisition Plan - All leases, regardless of dollar value, require acquisition planning. Leases over the Simplified Lease Acquisition Threshold (SLAT) must have a written acquisition plan approved at the appropriate level. The acquisition plan must be finalized before issuing the RLP. - The Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) is the primary law that ensures federal facilities are accessible to people with disabilities. It is required to be implemented in all new building construction leases, for which ABAAS serves as the standards document. (ABAAS) Best Value Tradeoff (BVTO) - The source selection process that permits tradeoffs among price and technical factors, allowing the Government to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror or the highest technically rated offeror (see FAR 15.101-1). In a BVTO procurement, the LCO must include price or cost to the Government, past performance, the planned participation of small disadvantaged business concerns in performance of the contract, and other factors as required by FAR 15.304 as evaluation factors. The contracting officer may include other evaluation factors as needed. Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) - The source selection process that selects the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price (see FAR 15.101-2). New or Replacing Leases - Leases with new terms and conditions and new lease contract numbers applicable for either a new requirement or to replace an existing expiring lease. PBS Leasing Desk Guide (LDG) - A comprehensive leasing guidance compilation which contains authorities, policies, technical and procedural guidance, and administrative limitations governing the acquisition for the leasing of real property. Peer Review - The pre- or post-award review of designs by the Chief Architect or designee all of whom serve as adjudicators, design advocates, and consensus builders for DE. Peer review during solicitation may involve team interviews, reference checks, and portfolio evaluation. Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) - The team of Government employees (not contractors) appointed by the Source Selection Authority DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 20 of 22 (SSA) to assist in a negotiated acquisition when using the Best Value Tradeoff process. The board typically consists of a chairperson, technical (non-voting) members and voting members, the Lease Contracting Officer, and a legal advisor. The customer agency may be represented on the SSEB in either a voting or non-voting capacity. The SSEB s design reviewers will include the Chief Architect or designee.

Purpose. Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single- sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women s domestic abuse shelters to women s workplace showers. This is wrong. Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system. Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself. This unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts. Invalidating the true and biological category of  woman  improperly trans- forms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept. Accordingly, my Administration will defend women s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male. Sec. 2. Policy and Definitions. It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Under my direc- tion, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpre- tation of and application of Federal law and administration policy: (a)  Sex  shall refer to an individual s immutable biological classification as either male or female.  Sex  is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of  gender identity.  (b)  Women  or  woman  and  girls  or  girl  shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively. (c)  Men  or  man  and  boys  or  boy  shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively. (d)  Female  means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell. (e)  Male  means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that pro- duces the small reproductive cell. (f)  Gender ideology  replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true.

Gender ideology is internally incon- sistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body. (g)  Gender identity  reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex. Sec. 3. Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men. (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order. (b) Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. Each agency should therefore give the terms  sex ,  male ,  female ,  men ,  women ,  boys  and  girls  the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications. (c) When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term  sex  and not  gender  in all applicable Federal policies and documents. (d) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees  sex, as defined by section 2 of this order. (e) Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, com- munications, or other internal and external messages that promote or other- wise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. Agency forms that require an individual s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity. Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology. (f) The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single- sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act. This position is legally untenable and has harmed women. The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities. In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent. (g) Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology. Sec. 4. Privacy in Intimate Spaces. (a) The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that males are not detained in women s prisons or housed in women s detention centers, including through amend- ment, as necessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act.

(c) The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate s appearance to that of the opposite sex. (d) Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity. Sec. 5. Protecting Rights. The Attorney General shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In accordance with that guidance, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the General Counsel and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act shall prioritize inves- tigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified. Sec. 6. Bill Text. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs shall present to the President proposed bill text to codify the definitions in this order. Sec. 7. Agency Implementation and Reporting. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, each agency head shall submit an update on implementa- tion of this order to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. That update shall address: (i) changes to agency documents, including regulations, guidance, forms, and communications, made to comply with this order; and (ii) agency-imposed requirements on federally funded entities, including contractors, to achieve the policy of this order. (b) The requirements of this order supersede conflicting provisions in any previous Executive Orders or Presidential Memoranda, including but not limited to Executive Orders 13988 of January 20, 2021, 14004 of January 25, 2021, 14020 and 14021 of March 8, 2021, and 14075 of June 15, 2022. These Executive Orders are hereby rescinded, and the White House Gender Policy Council established by Executive Order 14020 is dissolved. (c) Each agency head shall promptly rescind all guidance documents incon- sistent with the requirements of this order or the Attorney General s guidance issued pursuant to this order, or rescind such parts of such documents that are inconsistent in such manner. Such documents include, but are not limited to: (i)  The White House Toolkit on Transgender Equality ; (ii) the Department of Education s guidance documents including: (A)  2024 Title IX Regulations: Pointers for Implementation  (July 2024); (B)  U.S. Department of Education Toolkit: Creating Inclusive and Non- discriminatory School Environments for LGBTQI+ Students ; (C)  U.S. Department of Education Supporting LGBTQI+ Youth and Families in School  (June 21, 2023); (D)  Departamento de Educacio  n de EE.UU.

      "Summary": "After carefully analyzing the Design Excellence in Leasing Program Guidance (DE-LPG) and the Executive Order, here's a comprehensive assessment:\n\n1. Policy Summary:\nThe DE-LPG is a comprehensive guide for GSA's Design Excellence in Leasing Program, focusing on best practices for lease acquisitions involving new building construction. It outlines processes for project planning, source selection, design evaluation, and team roles in leasing projects.\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nThe executive order focuses on defining sex as a biological binary category and mandates federal agencies to:\n- Use strict biological definitions of male and female\n- Remove gender ideology from federal policies\n- Protect sex-based distinctions in federal spaces and documentation\n- Restrict gender identity considerations in federal programs\n\n3. Applicability Assessment:\nThe executive order has minimal direct impact on the DE-LPG. The policy document:\n- Does not mention gender identity\n- Focuses on design and procurement processes\n- Uses neutral, professional language about project requirements\n- Emphasizes technical and functional design considerations\n\nThe policy appears already compliant with the executive order's language and intent. No substantive changes are required.\n\n4. Next Steps:\nWhile no major revisions are necessary, recommended minor actions include:\n- Review document language to ensure continued neutrality\n- Confirm all forms and documentation use \"sex\" instead of \"gender\"\n- Ensure any future updates maintain biological categorization\n- Consult legal counsel for comprehensive compliance review\n\nRecommendation: No immediate policy modifications are required. Standard review processes should continue to ensure ongoing alignment.",

      "phase1_response": "## Policy Analysis: Design Excellence in Leasing Program Guidance vs. Executive Order 14168\n\n### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text\n\nThe Design Excellence in Leasing Program Guidance (DE-LPG) 2021 is a GSA policy document that establishes frameworks and procedures for applying design excellence principles to federal lease procurements, specifically for \"Lease Construction\" projects involving new building construction. The policy updates GSA's 2001 guidance and extends the agency's Design Excellence Program (established in 1994) to certain lease acquisitions. It focuses on ensuring expert-informed decision-making in design, construction, and project delivery processes to achieve superior quality outcomes on time, on budget, and within scope.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text\n\nExecutive Order 14168 (\"Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government\") directs federal agencies to base policies on biological definitions of sex rather than gender identity. The order mandates that federal policy recognize women as biologically female and men as biologically male, rejecting self-identification approaches to gender. It specifically addresses concerns about access to single-sex spaces and activities, emphasizing the protection of women's rights, dignity, safety, and well-being through clear, scientifically-based language and policies.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability\n\nThis executive order does **not appear to directly apply** to the Design Excellence in Leasing Program Guidance for the following reasons:\n\n- **Subject Matter Scope**: The DE-LPG focuses exclusively on architectural design standards, construction processes, project management, and leasing procedures. It does not address personnel policies, facility access rights, or sex-based classifications.\n\n- **Policy Content**: The available portions of the DE-LPG contain no language relating to gender, sex-based facilities, restroom policies, or similar topics that would trigger the executive order's requirements.\n\n- **Functional Purpose**: The policy serves as technical guidance for real estate and construction professionals regarding design excellence standards, not social policy or civil rights protections.\n\nHowever, there could be **indirect implications** if:\n- Future building designs under this program include single-sex facilities (restrooms, changing areas, etc.)\n- The policy eventually addresses accessibility or facility design standards that intersect with sex-based accommodations\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\n\nSince the policy does not appear directly affected, immediate compliance steps are minimal:\n\n**Immediate Actions:**\n- Complete review of the full DE-LPG document to confirm no gender-related provisions exist\n- Ensure any future updates to the guidance align with biological sex definitions when addressing facility design\n\n**Ongoing Monitoring:**\n- When implementing DE-LPG for specific projects, ensure building designs for single-sex facilities (restrooms, locker rooms, etc.) comply with the executive order's biological sex standards\n- Update any related design standards or architectural guidelines to reflect biological rather than gender identity-based classifications\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Maintain records showing compliance review was conducted\n- Note any design decisions that incorporate sex-based facility requirements\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**\n\nThe Design Excellence in Leasing Program Guidance appears to be a technical construction and design policy that does not directly implicate the sex and gender identity issues addressed in Executive Order 14168.",

It specifically governs GSA's approach to leasing federal office space, focusing on design quality, building performance, project management, and construction processes for leased facilities.\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**\nExecutive Order 14168 operates in the domain of civil rights, gender policy, and federal workplace regulations. It specifically addresses sex-based classifications, single-sex facilities, and federal government policies related to biological sex determination, particularly regarding access to sex-segregated spaces and activities.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nWhile these domains appear distinct at first glance, there is a significant intersection. The EO directly impacts federal workplace facilities and spaces, which are precisely what GSA's Design Excellence in Leasing Program governs. The EO's provisions about \"single-sex spaces\" and workplace facilities (specifically mentioning \"women's workplace showers\") directly affect how federal leased spaces must be designed and configured.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment**\nDespite the initial \"Not Affected\" flag, my analysis reveals clear connections. The EO establishes new requirements for sex-segregated facilities that would need to be incorporated into GSA's leasing and design standards.\n\n**Final Decision: [Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain:** Federal real estate leasing, design standards, and construction management for government facilities.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain:** Federal civil rights policy, sex-based facility access, and workplace regulations regarding single-sex spaces.\n\n3. **Direct Impact Analysis:** The executive order directly impacts the policy through several mechanisms:\n   - The EO establishes new federal requirements for \"single-sex spaces and activities\" in federal contexts\n   - It specifically mentions \"women's workplace showers,\" indicating direct application to federal workplace facilities\n   - GSA's leasing program must ensure leased facilities comply with all applicable federal requirements\n   - Design excellence guidance must now incorporate these new sex-based facility requirements\n\n4. **Key Supporting Language:**\n   - EO: \"permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces...from women's domestic abuse shelters to women's workplace showers\"\n   - EO: \"by the authority vested in me as President...it is hereby ordered\" - establishing binding federal policy\n   - Policy: \"ensures that the most appropriate expertise informs every step of the design, construction, and project-delivery processes\" - indicating comprehensive scope that would include compliance requirements\n\n5. **Nuances Considered:**\n   - While the policy focuses on design excellence rather than civil rights, GSA's leasing program must incorporate all federal compliance requirements into their design standards\n   - The EO's broad application to federal government operations would necessarily impact how federal facilities are designed and configured\n   - Design excellence in federal leasing inherently includes ensuring facilities meet all applicable federal standards and requirements\n\nThe executive order establishes new federal requirements that GSA's Design Excellence in Leasing Program must incorporate into their facility design and leasing standards.",

Purpose The purpose of this Procurement Instructional Bulletin (PIB) is to outline the guidelines for implementation and use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool. 2. Background The Skill Enhancement & Employee Development (SEED) program was created to provide the 1102 contract specialist community with a solid foundation, minimize acquisition skill gaps, and increase the overall knowledge and skills of the acquisition workforce. As part of SEED, the PATH tool was developed to give those in the 1102 acquisition community with little to no contracting knowledge a tool to learn and test their knowledge using scenario based exercises. The tool consists of various exercises categorized into the following modules: Pre-Award, Award, Post-Award, and Other. 3. Effective Date This PIB is effective on the date signed. The exercises that make up the training tool will be updated, as needed, to address any regulatory changes or Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) policy guidance 1800 F Street, NW Washington, DC 20405-0002 www.gsa.gov DocuSign Envelope ID: 3DF787F3-F9CB-4240-B6F6-E46C4D13456610/28/2022 revisions. 4. Cancellation Date This PIB will remain in effect until canceled. 5. Affected or Canceled Policies None. 6. Applicability This PIB applies to all Public Buildings Service (PBS) 1102s, including interns hired under the PBS Acquisition Intern Program. Use of the PATH tool is mandatory for new employees at the GS-09 level and below who are hired on or after the effective date of this tool. The tool is optional for those employees above the GS-09 level. 7. Exceptions The requirements of this PIB will not be applicable to employees who are participating under the Emerging Leaders Program (ELP), until they are converted to the 1102 series. 8. Instructions and Procedures Exercises & Answer Keys The exercises are broken into four modules: Pre-award, Award, Post-Award, and Other. There are two documents for each topic: the exercise and answer key. Links to all of the documents can be found on Attachment 1 - PATH Tool Table of Contents. Users should complete the exercises in chronological order. Some exercises have a service and construction type scenario. In those cases, users can elect to complete one or both exercises. The users will access the exercise, read the scenario, if one is included, and use the policy and guidance references to answer the questions. Only the regional supervisors will have access to the answer key documents. Upon completion of each exercise, users must work with their supervisor, or designee, to review their responses and compare them to the answer key. This will help ensure that users understand the general concepts of the exercise topic. 2 DocuSign Envelope ID: 3DF787F3-F9CB-4240-B6F6-E46C4D134566 New employees will be expected to complete the entire tool within 18 months of their start date. At a minimum, the first module (Pre-Award) is to be completed within the first year. FAI CSOD & CLPs Upon completion of all exercises in a module, users are to ensure that their completion is indicated in FAI Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD). To do this, supervisors are to complete the survey form linked as Attachment 2 - PATH Tool Supervisor Confirmation of Completion. Upon receipt, OAM will update FAI CSOD. This must be done for completion of each module. OAM will use this information to track completion of the tool. This process will also assist to provide continuous learning points (CLPs) to users who are eligible to receive them. 9.

Policy. American citizens deserve an excellent and efficient Federal workforce that attracts the highest caliber of civil servants committed to achieving the freedom, prosperity, and democratic rule that our Constitution promotes. But current Federal hiring practices are broken, insular, and out- dated. They no longer focus on merit, practical skill, and dedication to our Constitution. Federal hiring should not be based on impermissible factors, such as one s commitment to illegal racial discrimination under the guise of  equity,  or one s commitment to the invented concept of  gender iden- tity  over sex. Inserting such factors into the hiring process subverts the will of the People, puts critical government functions at risk, and risks losing the best-qualified candidates. By making our recruitment and hiring processes more efficient and focused on serving the Nation, we will ensure that the Federal workforce is prepared to help achieve American greatness, and attracts the talent necessary to serve our citizens effectively. By significantly improving hiring principles and practices, Americans will receive the Federal resources and services they deserve from the highest-skilled Federal workforce in the world. Sec. 2. Federal Hiring Plan. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the Administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), shall develop and send to agency heads a Federal Hiring Plan that brings to the Federal workforce only highly skilled Americans dedicated to the furtherance of American ideals, values, and interests. (b) This Federal Hiring Plan shall: (i) prioritize recruitment of individuals committed to improving the effi- ciency of the Federal government, passionate about the ideals of our American republic, and committed to upholding the rule of law and the United States Constitution; (ii) prevent the hiring of individuals based on their race, sex, or religion, and prevent the hiring of individuals who are unwilling to defend the Constitution or to faithfully serve the Executive Branch; (iii) implement, to the greatest extent possible, technical and alternative assessments as required by the Chance to Compete Act of 2024; (iv) decrease government-wide time-to-hire to under 80 days; (v) improve communication with candidates to provide greater clarity regarding application status, timelines, and feedback, including regular updates on the progress of applications and explanations of hiring decisions where appropriate; (vi) integrate modern technology to support the recruitment and selection process, including the use of data analytics to identify trends, gaps, and VerDate Sep<11>2014 18:45 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE9.SGM 30JAE9 5 1 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l 8622 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents opportunities in hiring, as well as leveraging digital platforms to improve candidate engagement; and (vii) ensure Department and Agency leadership, or their designees, are active participants in implementing the new processes and throughout the full hiring process.

(d) The Federal Hiring Plan shall provide specific best practices for the human resources function in each agency, which each agency head shall implement, with advice and recommendations as appropriate from DOGE. Sec. 3. Accountability and Reporting. (a) The Director of the Office of Per- sonnel Management shall establish clear performance metrics to evaluate the success of these reforms, and request agency analysis on a regular basis. (b) The Office of Personnel Management shall consult with Federal agen- cies, labor organizations, and other stakeholders to monitor progress and ensure that the reforms are meeting the needs of both candidates and agencies. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals; or (iii) the functions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee relating to its conduct of monetary policy.

Brief Summary of the Policy Text\n\nPBS Procurement Instructional Bulletin 23-01 establishes mandatory use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool for GSA Public Buildings Service acquisition personnel. The policy requires new employees at GS-09 level and below in the 1102 contract specialist series to complete scenario-based training exercises covering Pre-Award, Award, Post-Award, and Other acquisition modules. The PATH tool was developed under the Skill Enhancement & Employee Development (SEED) program to provide foundational contracting knowledge and minimize acquisition skill gaps. The training is optional for employees above GS-09 level.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of the Executive Order Text\n\nExecutive Order 14170 aims to reform federal hiring processes by focusing on merit, practical skills, and constitutional dedication rather than what it characterizes as \"impermissible factors\" such as commitments to \"racial discrimination under the guise of equity\" or \"gender identity over sex.\" The order mandates development of a Federal Hiring Plan within 120 days, involving the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, OMB Director, OPM Director, and Department of Government Efficiency Administrator to improve recruitment and hiring practices government-wide.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability\n\nThis executive order does **not** directly apply to PBS PIB 23-01. Here's why:\n\n- **Scope Distinction**: The executive order focuses on federal hiring and recruitment processes, while PIB 23-01 addresses post-hire training requirements for existing employees\n- **Different Phases**: The EO targets the selection and onboarding of new federal employees, whereas the PATH tool policy governs professional development after employees are already hired into 1102 positions\n- **Content Focus**: PIB 23-01 contains technical acquisition training requirements with no references to diversity, equity, inclusion policies, or protected characteristics that the executive order specifically targets\n- **Implementation Timing**: The PATH tool is implemented after hiring decisions are made and employees are assigned to acquisition roles\n\nThe policy operates in the post-hiring professional development space, which falls outside the executive order's hiring reform mandate.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nNo compliance actions are required because the policy is not affected by the executive order. However, as a best practice:\n\n- **Monitor Future Guidance**: Watch for any subsequent implementation guidance from OPM or GSA leadership that might affect training policies\n- **Review Training Content**: Ensure PATH tool content remains focused on technical acquisition competencies and regulatory compliance\n- **Continue Normal Operations**: Implement PIB 23-01 as written without modification\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

It focuses on reforming how the federal government recruits, selects, and hires employees, emphasizing merit, practical skills, and constitutional dedication while rejecting hiring based on \"impermissible factors\" like racial considerations under the guise of equity.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nWhile both documents relate to federal workforce management, they address fundamentally different aspects:\n- The policy deals with **post-hiring training** for existing federal employees in acquisition roles\n- The executive order deals with **pre-hiring processes** for recruiting new federal employees\n\nThe domains intersect at the broad level of federal workforce management but operate in distinct phases of the employment lifecycle.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment**\nDespite the phase1_flag indicating \"Not Affected,\" I must consider potential indirect impacts, particularly around the executive order's emphasis on \"merit\" and \"practical skill\" which could influence training program priorities.\n\n**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: Federal acquisition workforce training and professional development for existing 1102 contract specialists through the PATH tool and SEED program.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: Federal hiring reform focused on merit-based recruitment and selection processes for new federal employees.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: The executive order does not directly impact the policy because:\n   - The policy governs training of **current employees**, while the EO governs **hiring of new employees**\n   - The PATH tool mandate is an operational training requirement, not a hiring practice\n   - The EO's prohibition on \"impermissible factors\" in hiring does not extend to existing training programs\n   - No language in the EO suggests changes to established professional development programs\n\n4. **Key Supporting Language**: The EO specifically targets \"Federal hiring practices\" and \"hiring should not be based on impermissible factors,\" which are recruitment/selection activities, not post-employment training activities governed by the PBS bulletin.\n\n5. **Nuances Considered**: While both documents emphasize merit and skills, the EO's merit focus applies to candidate selection, whereas the policy's skill development occurs after employment. The temporal and functional separation between hiring (EO scope) and training (policy scope) maintains their independence. Any potential indirect influence on training program design would be speculative and insufficient to establish a direct policy relationship.",

Background. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins, and has never been hacked. As a result of its scarcity and security, Bitcoin is often referred to as  digital gold . Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The United States Government currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a policy to maximize BTC s strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system. Just as it is in our country s interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United States Digital Asset Stockpile that can serve as a secure account for orderly and strategic management of the United States  other digital asset holdings. Sec. 3. Creation and Administration of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  Stra- tegic Bitcoin Reserve,  capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency (agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to sub- section (d) of this section (Government BTC). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Govern- ment BTC held by it to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. Government BTC deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law. (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  United States Digital Asset Stockpile,  capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Stockpile Assets). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Stockpile Assets held by it to the United States Digital Asset Stockpile and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine strategies for responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile in accordance with applicable law.

However, the United States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other than in connection with crimi- nal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. (d)  Government Digital Assets  means all Government BTC and all Stock- pile Assets. The head of each agency shall not sell or otherwise dispose of any Government Digital Assets, except in connection with the Secretary of the Treasury s exercise of his lawful authority and responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, as required by law, or in cases where the Attorney General or other relevant agency head determines that the Government Digital Assets (or the proceeds from the sale or disposition thereof) can and should: (i) be returned to identifiable and verifiable victims of crime; (ii) be used for law enforcement operations; (iii) be equitably shared with State and local law enforcement partners; or (iv) be released to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705, 28 U.S.C. 524(c), 18 U.S.C. 981, or 21 U.S.C. 881. (e) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment considerations for establishing and managing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile going forward, including the accounts in which the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile should be located and the need for any legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order or the proper management and administration of such accounts. Sec. 4. Accounting. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall provide the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets with a full accounting of all Govern- ment Digital Assets in such agency s possession, including any information regarding the custodial accounts in which such Government Digital Assets are currently held that would be necessary to facilitate a transfer of the Government Digital Assets to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or the United States Digital Asset Stockpile. If such agency holds no Government Digital Assets, such agency shall confirm such fact to the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets within 30 days of the date of this order. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. 6 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:24 Mar 10, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\11MRE3.SGM 11MRE3 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 46 / Tuesday, March 11, 2025 / Presidential Documents 11791 (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order Text Summary:\nThe Executive Order establishes:\n- A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\n- A United States Digital Asset Stockpile\n- Requires agencies to account for and potentially transfer digital assets\n- Provides guidelines for managing government-held digital assets\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order does NOT directly impact the GSA Environmental Justice Committee Charter. \n\nKey reasons for non-applicability:\n- The executive order focuses on digital asset management\n- The EJC charter is specifically about environmental justice\n- There are no intersecting themes or mandates that would require policy modification\n- The EJC's objectives remain unchanged by digital asset management procedures\n\n4. Recommended Next Steps:\nNo immediate action is required for the EJC policy. \n\nStandard recommendation: \n- Maintain current EJC charter\n- Continue standard policy review processes\n- No compliance modifications needed based on this executive order\n\nRationale: The executive order is narrowly focused on digital asset management and does not introduce provisions that would alter the Environmental Justice Committee's established mission, structure, or operations.",

      "phase1_response": "## Policy Analysis Summary\n\n### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text\nThe GSA Environmental Justice Intragovernmental Committee Charter establishes an Environmental Justice Committee (EJC) within GSA to coordinate environmental justice activities in compliance with civil rights laws and multiple executive orders (E.O. 12250, 12898, 14008, and 14096). The EJC serves as a peer group to the existing Senior Sustainability Advisory Group and is responsible for providing policy advice, developing environmental justice strategic plans, and ensuring implementation of EJ activities across GSA programs.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text\nExecutive Order 14233 establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. The order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to create an office to manage custodial accounts for bitcoin (BTC) holdings from criminal/civil asset forfeiture proceedings and civil money penalties, positioning digital assets as strategic national resources similar to other government-managed commodities.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability\n**This executive order does not apply to the GSA Environmental Justice Committee policy.** The executive order is specifically focused on establishing cryptocurrency reserves and digital asset management within the Treasury Department, while the GSA policy addresses environmental justice coordination and compliance activities.\n\nKey reasons for non-applicability:\n- **Different subject matter**: The executive order deals with financial/digital assets, while the GSA policy addresses environmental justice and civil rights compliance\n- **Different agencies**: The executive order primarily tasks the Treasury Department, while the GSA policy is internal to GSA operations\n- **No operational overlap**: Environmental justice activities (community engagement, pollution reduction, equitable program delivery) have no direct connection to bitcoin reserve management\n- **Distinct regulatory frameworks**: The policies operate under entirely different legal authorities and compliance requirements\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\n**No compliance actions are required** because this executive order does not affect the Environmental Justice Committee Charter. The GSA should:\n- Continue implementing the existing Environmental Justice Strategic Plan as outlined in the charter\n- Maintain focus on the referenced executive orders that do apply (E.O. 12898, 14008, and 14096)\n- Monitor for any future executive orders that might actually relate to environmental justice or GSA operations\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

      "phase2_response": "**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**\nThe policy relates to **Environmental Justice** - specifically establishing a committee to manage and coordinate environmental justice activities within GSA. The policy references civil rights compliance, environmental justice for minority and low-income populations, climate action, and sustainability coordination.\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**\nThe executive order relates to **Digital Asset/Cryptocurrency Policy** - specifically establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile for the United States. This is a financial/monetary policy focused on cryptocurrency holdings and strategic positioning in digital assets.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nThese are fundamentally different policy domains:\n- **Policy**: Environmental justice, civil rights, climate action, sustainability\n- **Executive Order**: Digital assets, cryptocurrency, financial reserves, monetary policy\n\nThere is no apparent connection between environmental justice committee operations and bitcoin reserve establishment.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment Context**\nThe phase1_flag of \"Not Affected\" aligns with the clear separation of these policy areas. No reasonable pathway exists for a bitcoin reserve policy to impact environmental justice committee charter operations.\n\n**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: Environmental Justice - The policy establishes an Environmental Justice Committee within GSA to coordinate activities related to civil rights compliance, environmental justice for vulnerable populations, and climate action initiatives.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: Digital Asset/Financial Policy - The executive order creates a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve focused on cryptocurrency holdings as a store of value and strategic financial positioning.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect relationship between these domains. Environmental justice activities (community engagement, civil rights compliance, climate equity) operate independently from federal cryptocurrency reserve policies. The bitcoin reserve establishment would not alter environmental justice committee operations, charter requirements, or environmental justice implementation.\n\n4. **Supporting Language**: The policy text focuses on \"environmental justice activities,\" \"minority populations and low-income populations,\" and \"climate crisis\" coordination. The EO text addresses \"digital gold,\" \"strategic bitcoin reserve,\" and \"global financial system\" positioning. No overlapping terminology or functional areas exist.\n\n5. **Edge Case Consideration**: Even considering potential indirect effects (e.g., federal budget implications), the bitcoin reserve policy would not specifically impact environmental justice committee operations or charter requirements. These operate at different organizational levels and functional areas within government.\n\nThe domains are entirely separate with no logical connection between bitcoin reserves and environmental justice committee operations.",

Carnahan The General Services Administration s overarching goal is delivering efficient, effective government for the American people. As we look to the future, we re codifying another element into that goal: equity. The sacred trust between government and its citizens should inform every action, every decision, and every policy. It s our responsibility to get people the services they need, when they need them   that s why we re taking a people-centered approach to government. We know that government only works when it works for everyone, so I m proud to renew GSA s commitment to delivering a government that s equitable, accessible, and inclusive of the diverse nation we serve. GSA has a big role to play in fulfilling the mission of government, whether we re investing in American jobs, partnering with American industry and trade labor, delivering digital government with good customer experience, building a more sustainable future, or bolstering the strength of communities across the country. In all this, we re committed to making meaningful equity impacts, recognizing that equitable approaches lead to better outcomes for everyone. That s why our Equity Action Plan is so important. The heart of this plan is community and it provides us with ways we can both transform government in the long-term and ensure that what the government delivers has meaningful impacts on the daily lives of people all across the country. The good news is that we have the money and the momentum to make these kinds of impacts real. From Day One, the President has been focused on Investing in America   in our people, in our infrastructure, and in rebuilding our economy through historic, once-in-a-generation investments. I ve been out on the road a lot this year and I ve seen these strategies in action firsthand. To start, with over $6 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, we re making smart investments in GSA-controlled Federal buildings all across the country. We re focused on building spaces that are part of the communities they inhabit, modernizing them so they can easily provide services to the American people, and ensuring their resilience and sustainability. With every investment, we re seeking to address climate change because it s a triple win: creating good jobs, saving taxpayer dollars, and making a healthier future for generations to come. We know that historically underserved communities are too-often disproportionately impacted by climate change, so we re making sure that this triple win benefits everyone. 1 U.S. General Services Administration From Arizona to Ohio, I ve heard from workers that are proud to be part of this national transformation and that they see the benefits to their families, their communities, and American businesses. I ve met with trade labor unions, workers, and leaders in the building and construction industry, all of whom have shared with me how they re committed to these same goals. They re recruiting more women and people of color and training them in the tools and technologies we need to implement billions of dollars in investments. They know what we know: these investments will create pathways to the middle-class, strengthen communities across the country, and build a stronger and more prosperous future for everyone. At our federal buildings, we ve been partnering with local small businesses to guide them through the process of accessing opportunities across the Federal marketplace. We ve also been partnering with opportunity centers to raise awareness of these projects among the local communities. There s one location in D.C. where we ve helped over 35 businesses get onto government schedules and helped secure jobs for over 2,500 people. We re also focused on the physical accessibility of our buildings through our National Accessibility Program, the many efforts of our Office of Design and Construction, and our long-standing relationship with the U.S. Access Board. We also partnered with Challenge.gov to launch the  Access for All  universal and accessible design competition for U.S. architecture students to source best practice improvements. As the caretaker of the nation s largest public art collection, we ve preserved and expanded the people s collection over the last 50 years, placing art in Federal buildings and public spaces that tells the story of our nation and our democracy. We re committed to expanding opportunities for new artists to contribute, creating jobs while ensuring that the diversity and vibrancy of our portfolio reflects the diversity and vibrancy of the American story. Our Federal Acquisition Service and Office of Small & Disadvantaged Business Utilization are committed to making it easier for businesses to succeed in the Federal marketplace. From forecasting tools and new identifiers for a diverse range of businesses to training and outreach programs, we re actively expanding our supplier diversity, reducing barriers, and improving outcomes. In fact, GSA awarded more than $3.3 billion to small businesses, which represents over 50% of the agency's FY23 eligible spending, according to data current as of November 2, 2023. GSA s work delivering  services that are simple to use, accessible, equitable, protective, transparent, and responsive for all people  is evident in our digital capabilities as well. Our public-facing websites are 508 compliant, support assistive technology, and are available in multiple languages. In fact, Vote.gov has recently added its first Alaska Native language and multiple Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander languages to increase accessibility while supporting cultural vitality. We re also 2 U.S. General Services Administration engaging in equity studies across our Technology Transformation Services to ensure that we re providing human-centered tools that meet the needs of every American. We ve been partnering across the government as well. Our Office of Government-wide Policy IT Accessibility team helps agencies meet Federal compliance standards while our U.S. Web Design Services offers toolkits and best practices to ensure that Federal websites are accessible for everyone   that includes providing specific resources to support customers in varying socio-economic communities. Through our work with the Department of Labor s Good Jobs Initiative, we re helping improve job quality and create access to good union jobs free from discrimination and harassment for all working people, with an emphasis on people of color, LGBTQ+, women, veterans, immigrants, individuals in rural communities, and individuals with disabilities. Finally, we ve been committed to strengthening ties and trust between Tribal Nations and the United States. From attending the Reservation Economic Summit and hosting our first Native Nations Industry Day at GSA Headquarters to holding nation-to-nation consultations and visiting with Tribal leaders and communities, we re building Nation-to- Nation partnerships so that our work in Indian Country strengthens businesses and communities. Looking to the future, GSA s updated action plan aims to further advance equity through the agency s high-impact program areas like Federal procurement, Federal buildings, and Federal technology design and delivery. It also gives increased emphasis to GSA s role in helping to strengthen the government s ability to be more agile, responsive, and reflective of Americans  needs through evaluation and data-driven insights. By focusing on these five strategies, GSA will use its unique position of delivering mission-critical services and core products across government to act as a force multiplier in advancing equity and reducing burdens for underserved communities. That is what good government is all about   and GSA is proud to do our part to strengthen our democracy and foster more trust between the Federal Government and the American people. Robin C. Carnahan Administrator, U.S. General Services Administration 3 U.S. General Services Administration Advancing Equity Through Agency Mission The mission of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is to deliver the best customer experience and value in real estate, acquisition, and technology services to the government and the American people. As we work to meet our goals of delivery on behalf of the government, we are only meeting our mission as a federal agency if the American people can equitably benefit from our efforts. That means that as GSA leverages its over $85 billion buying power to provide Federal purchasers with cost-effective, high-quality products and services from commercial vendors, we are also advancing the diversity of the American supplier base and economic security for small businesses. When we provide critical technology services and modernizations, GSA has a mission to ensure that digital government is reflective of and designed to perform for all the diverse communities we serve. As GSA plans and completes large scale construction projects across our 375 million rentable square feet of Federal real estate, we do so in a manner that is informed by local communities to ensure that the sustainability, vitality and livability made possible through Federal investment is available to every American neighborhood. GSA s mission is government delivery   and that includes delivering on the American promise of equal opportunity, civil rights, and justice for all. Executive Summary In response to Executive Order 14091 on Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, the U.S. General Services Administration has undertaken an agenda to operationalize equity across its public-facing mission critical programs and services. Not only do these updated strategies build on the successes and learnings from our 2022 Equity Action Plan, they further integrate cross-cutting equity goals in important and impactful ways. Deeper synergies are possible to realize across priorities related to economic justice, sustainable and equitable development, customer experience and digital government, gender equity, environmental justice, protecting civil rights, and support for an ecosystem of sociodemographic community groups, Tribes, and institutions. Another core tenet of this plan is GSA s commitment to expanding Federal interagency coordination and advancing meaningful engagement with the public when it matters most and can make a difference. This collaborative posture reflects GSA s unique role in government as an agency that supports other agencies in their mission success. GSA s business is the business of government - whether that is helping buyers and sellers connect more efficiently and equitably in Federal marketplaces, modernizing and delivering high-impact digital solutions, challenging industry to join us in tackling the climate crisis through sustainable supply chain innovations, or driving the revitalization of American neighborhoods by putting people to work in their communities with good jobs paid for by once-in-a-generation infrastructure investments. This plan outlines five strategies to advance and embed equity in Fiscal Year (FY) 2024:   Advance Equity, Economic Justice, and the Diversity of the American Supplier Base through Federal Procurement. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objective of economic justice; and it aims to address barriers faced by small and disadvantaged businesses as they participate in the Federal marketplace. Key actions are designed to improve contracting efficiency and success through data insights, innovative procurement tools, and greater collaboration across Federal agencies. 4 U.S. General Services Administration   Deliver Equitable, Accessible and Inclusive Digital Government to the American Public. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objectives of Economic Justice and Civil Rights; and it aims to address potential barriers and biases present in public interactions with civic tech. Key actions include advancing human centered design and community-informed user research practices, scaling language access, and ensuring responsible adoption and procurement of AI-enabled technologies.   Advance Equity, Economic Security, Sustainability and Environmental Justice through Large-Scale Construction Projects and the Federal Buildings Footprint. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objectives of Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, and Housing Justice and Community Investment; and it aims to address barriers to community benefits realized through equitable and sustainable Federal development. Key actions are designed to improve planning and access to local opportunities - like good jobs and cleaner, more climate change-resilient communities, made possible by landmark Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act investments.   Advance Equity and Effectiveness of Federal Programs Through Rigorous Review, Evaluation and Continuous Improvement. This strategy supports the whole- of-government equity objectives of Civil Rights, Health Equity, Economic Justice, Global Equality; and it aims to ensure Federal programs are working as intended, particularly programs that provide critical support to the public during emergencies and recovery after disasters. Key actions include scaling the Federal Government s use of evaluations to surface important findings and areas of improvement in the design and delivery of Federal programs.   Advance Equitable Access to Opportunity and Federal Resources for Local Communities and Minority Serving Institutions. This strategy supports the whole-of- government equity objectives of Civil Rights and Economic Justice; and it aims to reduce barriers to access for institutions that, through Federal resources, help close critical gaps in capacity and infrastructure for the local communities they serve. Key actions include conducting proactive civil rights compliance reviews of the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program and broadening partnerships - including contracting agreements - between Federal agencies and Minority Serving Institutions. Approaches to the five strategies are meant to be tactical and have measurable outcomes. At the heart of these strategies are the American people   particularly those who are overcoming systemic burdens, have been locked out of a fair chance at opportunities or are disproportionately in the path of harm when disaster strikes. GSA has developed our agency actions to reflect the needs of the people, identified through data and feedback collected in our own regular engagement and evaluation practices and with the help of thoughtfully researched insights generated from trusted industry experts and Federal partners. 5 U.S. General Services Administration Equity Progress Updates and Accomplishments 2022 Equity Action Plan Update In January 2022, GSA released its inaugural Equity Action Plan in accordance with Executive Order 13985: Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. To develop this plan, GSA conducted equity assessments and identified a set of actions for three high-impact program areas: Federal procurement, Federal buildings footprint, and Federal technology design and delivery. The section below provides an overview of the key accomplishments achieved since publication of the original Equity Action Plan. Advancing Equity and Supplier Diversity in Federal Procurement   In FY 2022, $2.8 billion of GSA contracting obligations went to small businesses, including 21.4% to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs); In FY 2023, GSA increased its small business contracting obligations to $3.3 billion, representing over 50% of the agency s eligible spending.   Launched a new Supplier Base Dashboard to provide more transparency and public reporting on Federal efforts to increase the number of new entrants to the Federal marketplace and reverse the general decline in the small business supplier base.   Signed a new 8(a) partnership agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration to increase 8(a) contracting opportunities and make it easier for Federal agencies to buy from 8(a) businesses for common goods and services needs.   Established new contracting pools in the growing Federal marketplace of Information Technology services and solutions to bolster participation of Women-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran- Owned Small Business, and small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones. The 8(a) STARS III contracts have been awarded to 1,111 SDB. 290  rising stars  have received their first awards exceeding $925 million in obligations.   Expanded tools to support Minority Serving Institutions with training and technical assistance to achieve success in the Federal contracting marketplace.   Established a Post-Award Engagement strategy to support disadvantaged and socioeconomic small businesses, which oftentimes still face challenges in successfully earning sales after being awarded a GSA contract.   Published the first-ever Supplier Diversity Plan to support Federal marketplace participation of SDB.   Updated the Multiple Award Schedule Welcome Package and Roadmap to improve information access and assist new contractors with success in marketing and managing their contracts. 6 Advancing Equity and Accessibility in Federal Technology U.S. General Services Administration   Launched an Equity Study on Remote Identity, recruiting 4,000 Americans, to understand potential barriers and demographic disparities in identity verification technologies that are commonly used by the public when accessing Federal services and benefits.   Developed and started implementing a roadmap for USAGov and USAGov en Espa ol to streamline content and make it easier for the public to find and access Federal benefits and services across a digital platform that connects people with government information more than 117 million times a year.   Vote.gov worked to expand access to voter registration information in communities that, due to language barriers, have not been historically part of the electorate. The platform added several Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) languages including: Bengali, Khmer, Korean, Hindi, Tagalog, and Vietnamese, with Chinese (both simplified and traditional) and its first Alaska Native language, Yup ik- Akuzipik.   Login.gov partnered with Federal agencies and State governments to provide secure, accessible identity verification services for benefits and emergency assistance programs. As an example, the U.S. Department of Labor pilot in Arkansas, helping more than 19,000 citizens of the State verify their identities while applying for unemployment benefits.   Advanced public participation and equitable user research practices through user compensation pilots and increased outreach efforts to community-based organizations.   Partnered with the U.S. Web Design System to launch new Inclusion Pattern Guidance, a library of design guidance and examples focused on reducing the public s barriers in key digital government interactions and fostering effective, inclusive, and equitable digital experiences. Advancing Equity and Sustainability in the Public Buildings Footprint   Leveraged the Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool and Federal Interagency Thriving Communities Network to develop engagement strategies that advance sustainable and equitable development goals and connect communities with resources in large-scale Federal investments made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.   Established partnerships with the U.S. Department of Labor on the Mega Construction Project Program and Good Jobs Initiative to advance equal opportunity in the construction trade workforce and expand the use of Project Labor Agreements on Federal projects over $35 million.   Launched the Access-for- All universal design challenge for U.S. architecture students and apprentices to source best national ideas on improving the accessibility and gender inclusiveness of Federal properties.   Partnered with the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and updated the Art in Architecture program rules to expand public access and artist representation in the millions of dollars of commissioned artworks permanently installed in Federal facilities. 7 U.S. General Services Administration   Issued recommendations from the Environmental Justice and Equity in Federal Sustainable Buildings Task Group and appointed two new environmental justice subject matter experts to the Green Building Advisory Committee, a Federal advisory committee that explores the climate modernization and sustainable development of Federal real estate in ways that are responsive to the needs of local communities.   Commissioned a survey and issued a first-ever GSA report on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) practices in design and construction industries.   Partnered with the National organization of Minority Architects to expand career opportunities for underserved communities in the architecture, engineering, design, and construction industries. Additional Efforts to Advance Equity Implementation of Landmark Legislation   The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) was designed to address immediate needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on addressing historically disparate outcomes across race, class, and geography that were further exacerbated by the pandemic. To support the Federal Government s exploration of questions about equitable recovery, GSA s Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) established an ARP Evaluation Portfolio with two core elements: a national evaluation conducted by a third-party research contract, and a portfolio of evaluations conducted by OES, in partnership with agencies and the White House Office of Management and Budget, on ARP-funded programs with equity goals. This body of work explores effectiveness of critical relief programs like Emergency Rental Assistance and Homeowner Assistance Fund.   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides $3.4 billion for GSA s Public Buildings Service, making a significant impact on 26 Land Ports of Entry modernizations along the Canadian and Mexican border. These projects will create new good-paying jobs, bolster safety and security, and make our economy more resilient to supply chain challenges   all while serving as models for sustainability and innovation and improving community livability.   The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides GSA with $2.15 billion for low-embodied carbon materials in construction and renovation projects, $975 million for GSA to support emerging and sustainable technologies, and $250 million to turn even more GSA facilities into High-Performance Green Buildings and accelerate efforts to achieve a net- zero Federal footprint. These investments will reduce long-term energy costs for American communities, strengthen America s domestic industrial base and catalyze innovation and job growth in homegrown industries that produce next-generation materials, products, and equipment. GSA estimates that these projects will create over 9,500 average annual economy-wide jobs across the length of the projects, support $2.8 billion in labor income, and generate nearly $1 billion in tax revenue for Federal, State and local governments. 8 Support for Tribes and Native Communities U.S. General Services Administration   GSA has prioritized engaging in Tribal Consultations in a proactive and meaningful manner throughout Fiscal Year 23. In addition to robust Tribal engagement as part of BIL project planning, GSA hosted the agency s first formal in-person Tribal Consultation event at the Reservation Economic Summit (RES) in April 2023. Over 100 participants joined Administrator Carnahan and GSA leaders for discussions on major topics of interest to Indian Country, including GSA s support of tribes, small business contracting, partnering with GSA to procure electric vehicles, and a pilot program to support Federal buying of carbon pollution-free electricity from Tribal organizations. Also, GSA issued a Guide to Using GSA Solutions and debuted a new search feature that enables buyers to search for Native American business categories in the GSA Advantage! , GSA eBuy and GSA eLibrary e-tools to find commercial products and services. This will foster greater Native American business participation in the Federal marketplace, help customers more easily meet Buy Indian Act needs, and strengthen the ability for tribes to pursue intertribal commerce efforts. Environmental Justice   GSA is committed to institutionalizing the principles of Justice40 - ensuring that the benefits of Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution, advancing equitable and sustainable development, and mitigating the disproportionate burdens faced by underserved communities in the climate crisis. Our Good Neighbor Program helps construction project teams, local governments and communities address common environmental justice challenges - like flooding from aging water systems, heat islands caused by lack of tree canopy, and air pollution from commercial traffic patterns - during the urban planning process. GSA s Environmental Justice Scorecard highlights include 27 Tribal Consultations related to environmental justice from January 2021 to September 2022 and improving environmental justice literacy through training provided to GSA s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Network. Strategies to Advance Equity in Fiscal Year 2024 Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Economic Justice Strategy #1: Advance Equity, Economic Justice, and the Diversity of the American Supplier Base through Federal Procurement Barriers to Equity Through existing public research and GSA s own regular industry engagement efforts, the agency has identified core challenges1 facing disadvantaged small business communities that impede their success and contribute to persistent systemic economic disparities. Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) and Socioeconomic Small Businesses (SESBs)2 are vulnerable to compounding obstacles in achieving competitive pricing, administrative burdens in 1 The Probability of Winning Federal Contracts: An Analysis Of Small Minority Owned Firms (June 2022), U.S. Department of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency. 2 Includes SBA certified socioeconomic set-aside categories: 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Tribes and Tribal- owned businesses, and small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones 9 U.S. General Services Administration navigating government s diffuse information and processes, and disproportionately negative outcomes relative to other businesses while competing for Federal contracts and obligations   including the approximately $85 billion in annual contracts facilitated by GSA. GSA s plan to advance equity in Federal procurement coordinates and builds on key actions that take a holistic approach to reducing barriers and improving outcomes at critical stages of the Federal contracting lifecycle, with the goal to increase overall marketplace participation rates and the amount of Federal contracting dollars awarded to underserved and disinvested communities. Key Actions Enable greater Federal contracting marketplace transparency and efficiency through data-driven tools and insights. Federal agencies and the Federal acquisition workforce play a critical role in creating, sustaining, and growing opportunities where small businesses can fairly compete and succeed in being awarded government contracts. GSA is committed to helping buyers and sellers more effectively execute on all eligible small business opportunities, which includes our role in providing contracting data insights to the Federal Government and the public in support of these goals:   Expand Federal agency use of the Forecast of Contracting Opportunities Tool. The tool assists with acquisition planning by helping vendors learn about potential prime contracting opportunities early in the process. Improved search functionality will simplify the process for the Federal user to post and maintain opportunities. Maximizing Federal agency use of the tool and creating a single forecast for the public to access will greatly ease the burden on small businesses attempting to track opportunities across multiple sources of information.   Launch and scale Federal agency adoption of new Government-wide Procurement Equity Tool. The tool uses Federal contracting data sources to support market research focused on small disadvantaged businesses. Federal agencies can use the tool to find SDBs by geographic location, business type and category. Agencies can also find new SDBs that have registered to do business but have yet to receive a federal award.   Enhance eBuy, the Request for Quote (RFQ) platform for GSA Schedule. eBuy is a powerful and intuitive acquisition tool used by thousands of Federal agencies and military services worldwide to help save government time and money as acquisitions achieve required competition, best pricing and value. Planned and ongoing updates to eBuy include new features that benefit both buyers and sellers by creating more visibility and simplification in quoting, Request for Information (RFI), and RFQ interactions. Facilitate greater supplier diversity and contracting success through GSA acquisition products and innovation. GSA acquisition vehicles are trusted and proven entry points for small businesses to begin and find early success in the Federal marketplace. The Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) and Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) are standout sources of eligible award dollars available to small disadvantaged businesses to compete for contracts in Federal common goods and services, and in high-growth categories like information technology and solutions. GSA supports overall governmentwide procurement equity efforts by ensuring the universe of our own contracting opportunities drive innovation and are responsive to the complex needs of our customers and vendors. These actions include:   Establish and implement a new 8(a) partnership agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration. This new 8(a) partnership agreement makes it easier for Federal agencies to use GSA s Government-wide contracts, including the Federal Supply Schedules, to identify and make awards to 8(a) firms. Creation of an 8(a) 10 U.S. General Services Administration Schedule pool will allow for sole source opportunities to SDBs, which significantly reduces burden on small businesses to obtain orders and gain Federal work experience. GSA will update the solicitation to begin adding new 8(a) contractors to the Schedule, will enhance eTools to identify eligible 8(a) contractors on eBuy and GSA Advantage! and will update and roll-out training for its acquisition workforce and Federal agencies on the new process.   Create new sustainability-focused markets in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Defense. Climate risk adaptation efforts and Federal sustainability goals are positioned to deploy hundreds of millions of dollars in new acquisition opportunities, including those available to small businesses, over the near/medium term. GSA is driving new and emerging market successes in Low Embodied Carbon building materials, Zero-Emission Vehicles and supply equipment, scaling of eco-labels to reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and expediting procurement availability of environmental technologies.   Finalize solicitations and awards for new Polaris and OASIS+ contracts.3 These newly launched governmentwide IT and professional services contracts offer more opportunities for small businesses to compete for prime contracts, including small business and socioeconomic set-asides. Since 2015, GSA s current OASIS vehicle has helped Federal agencies obligate more than $67 billion. Improve accessibility and reduce administrative burden. GSA committed to reviewing 37 Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) forms and identifying six design changes to appearance and layout (e.g., limiting use of capitalization and italics, continuity of 12-point font and bolded text for readability) that could make the standard forms easier to navigate for people with dyslexia, limited vision and intellectual disabilities. GSA will redesign FAR forms and launch a public awareness campaign about the updates. For FY 2024, GSA will also increase its pledge to the AbilityOne program, a critical source for buying goods and services from suppliers who support the employment of people with disabilities.     Further implement and enhance the Post-Award Engagement (PAE) Strategy. Fiscal Year 2023 sales data for SDBs and SESBs will serve as the Year 1 baseline to evaluate the efficacy of PAE plan activities. Based on analysis, GSA will update actions for post-award interventions that address the phenomena of persistent low or no sales, including: targeted training, matchmaking industry days and technical assistance. Measuring Our Progress: Federal Procurement Equity GSA will know if we are achieving measurable results for the small business communities we serve by tracking quarterly and annual progress against key metrics, including:     increased number and percentage of disadvantaged and socioeconomic small businesses active in core GSA marketplaces; increased total dollars and percentage obligated to SDBs and SESBs relative to GSA s overall eligible annual spending;   downward trends in number and percentage of SDBs and SESBs with no or low sales;   upward trends in SDBs and SESBs average dollar value of awards and percentage of market share;   upward trends in SDBs and SESBs overall new entrants and increased participation in high-growth and emerging market segments; improved overall qualitative data results from customer and vendor surveys, focus   3 GSA is responsive to any protest decisions and remains committed to providing opportunities for small businesses while supporting Federal agencies in their small business goals. 11 groups, and training feedback. U.S. General Services Administration Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Economic Justice Strategy #2: Deliver Equitable, Accessible and Inclusive Digital Government to the American Public Barriers to Equity Although technology continues to rapidly evolve, persistent inequities in technology design and delivery   like higher false rejection rates, completion failure rates, and time burdens - disproportionately negatively impact those from historically and socially marginalized communities. Additionally, digital services very often fail to prioritize human-centered design and usability beyond compliance. This means that Americans who likely have a critical need to connect with government information and services through digital platforms also are likely to have the hardest time doing so. Examples include both lack of access to the newest hardware or good internet, which often means newer digital platforms do not perform as well (because they are not built for older devices or don t work with low bandwidth connections), or software that is not designed to work across all populations, such as lack of plain language impacting populations with limited English proficiency or poorly trained AI models causing biometric systems to perform worse for people with different ages or skin tones. GSA   through its consulting and fellowships offerings such as the Centers of Excellence and the Presidential Innovation Fellows, shared services such as Login.gov and the US Web Design System, and Federal partners in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and United States Digital Service   plays a central role in the responsible development, deployment, and procurement of technologies used by the Federal Government to communicate or interact with the public.4 GSA is committed to delivering high-impact digital services and products in a manner that improves customer experience, reduces burden, broadens access, and advances civic tech practices that are intrinsically equity-aware and community-informed. Key Actions Mitigate bias and advance responsible adoption of civic technologies, including machine learning-enabled and emerging technologies. GSA s own internal product testing processes, as well as publicly available, peer-reviewed technical research studies from academic institutions and government research partners - like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - have identified user experience disparities and efficacy gaps in machine learning and AI-enabled technologies that adversely impact users, including: people with darker skin tones, people in rural areas with low bandwidth, people using older electronic devices, nonbinary and transgender people, people with disabilities, and people whose native language is not English.5 The negative impacts listed above compound for government websites and digital services, including services that have the potential to impact rights (like access to benefits or other government services). For example, a user with darker skin tone who is more likely to live in a neighborhood with low-bandwidth internet access and have an older device is thus more likely to experience increased friction in their attempt to use a government website or service. 4 AI Guide for Government, IT Modernization Centers of Excellence; Blueprint for AI Bill of Rights, OSTP 5 Face Recognition Technology Evaluation (FRTE) Part 1: Verification (2023), NIST 12 U.S. General Services Administration   Complete the Equity Study on Remote Identity-Proofing and publish findings. GSA launched the study and is recruiting 4,000 members of the public for participation. The peer-reviewed final report will present a statistical analysis of the performance of proofing checks, like facial verification, across a number of sociodemographic factors and explore the causes behind any negative or inconclusive results. GSA will use the results of this study, in combination with findings from other Federal agency efforts, to establish recommendations and inform future product iteration, including on Login.gov.   Advance equity through civic tech shared services and large-scale modernization investments. GSA provides expertise via a portfolio of mission critical digital government projects through its universe of technologists and product managers in TTS Consulting, Presidential Innovation Fellows, U.S. Digital Corps and the Benefits Studio. The agency also supports improvements to government delivery and IT infrastructure, including automation, through investments made by the Technology Modernization Fund. These platforms are positioned to apply equity frameworks in the way government programs and services are effectively designed and delivered to the American public. Expand digital accessibility, language access, public participation and equitable user research practices. Traditional outreach, user research, data collection (including Artificial Intelligence-trained datasets), content strategy and customer experience testing methods often do not sufficiently include underrepresented groups. This means that as technology is built and deployed, those end users of the public who likely most need to connect with government information and services will often have the most difficulty accessing them. GSA will continue actions that strengthen relationships with stakeholders and meaningfully integrate the needs of communities as part of our digital services.   Strengthen relationships with underserved user communities and build capacity for research operations. Governmentwide customer experience efforts focus on improving the digital interactions of communities and individuals with accessibility needs such as physical or mental disabilities and those experiencing major life events such as recovering from disasters, emergencies or financial shock, new and expecting parents, and those planning for retirement. GSA will continue integrating usability testing and research operations capabilities, including the expansion of user compensation pilots,6 to directly track how well our digital services are working and meeting the diverse needs of the public.   Modernize GSA s high-impact7 service providers to improve digital accessibility and language access. GSA s public-facing digital assets like USA.gov, Login.gov and Vote.gov connect tens of millions of Americans to Federal services and information. GSA will continue modernization efforts to make our digital services more accessible, understandable, and easy-to-use. This includes platforming new language translations and designing from native speaker experiences, like USAGov en Espa ol, as well as driving universal design standards in partnership with U.S. Web Design System.   Develop a plain-language accessibility checklist in collaboration with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). This will enable any team developing cloud-based services and digital solutions to incorporate accessibility into their process, regardless of their expertise. Operationalizing accessibility knowledge and evaluation for Federal employee use helps improve overall digital government 6 Handbook: Doing Research at GSA Technology Transformation Services 7 Federal agency High Impact Service Providers (HISP) are identified by the President s Management Agenda due to the scale and impact of their public-facing services. 13 accessibility and performance outcomes for older devices, such as, and especially for mobile, rural, and low-bandwidth users. U.S. General Services Administration Measuring Our Progress: Equitable and Accessible Digital Government GSA will know if we are achieving measurable positive change in Federal public-serving digital products and services by tracking progress against key metrics, including:             reduced negative impacts (e.g., false rejection rates in biometric identity-proofing, task completion rates, slow page load times for low- and limited-bandwidth connections) and closing those efficacy gaps across sociodemographic factors increased product efficacy and higher overall scores in usability tests increased digital accessibility fluency and compliance across GSA high-impact products increased number of community-based organizations with active user research pipelines for GSA product testing increased and proportionate participation of users from underserved community groups in GSA product testing at scale increased number of available and platform-integrated non-English languages in high- impact digital services and products Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, Housing Justice and Community Investment Strategy #3: Advance Equity, Economic Security and Environmental Justice through Large-Scale Construction Projects and the Federal Buildings Footprint Barriers to Equity The Federal real estate footprint - including the 375 million rentable square feet owned and operated by GSA - has significant generational impact on communities nationwide. Federal construction projects act as anchors for economic security, reliable opportunities for good local jobs, defenses against the negative impacts of climate change, and can advance the overall livability and vitality of American communities. GSA s work often occurs in or adjacent to disadvantaged communities that have suffered from long-standing underinvestment and have dealt with historic challenges and barriers to equitable development. These communities tend to have poor transportation connectivity to job opportunities, higher exposure to many forms of pollution, and less access to green space. The impacts of this inequity are apparent in the persistent lower household income, high unemployment, and poorer health outcomes.8 In order to help overcome these barriers, GSA is executing projects with enhanced stakeholder engagement and data analysis to better inform GSA decisionmakers and project teams about local development contexts and better connect project location, design, and facility operations with the needs of those communities that will benefit from more equitable development. Projects implemented under the nearly $7 billion made available to GSA through historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) investments are poised to bolster economies with small and local business participation, improve job and jobsite quality for workers and trade labor, address sustainability and environmental justice concerns, and strengthen relationships between levels of government, Tribes, and communities. 8 Assessing the Legacies of Historical Redlining, Urban Institute (2023) 14 U.S. General Services Administration Key Actions Aid the economic success of construction industries, contractors, and labor forces. Governmentwide implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is estimated to create 800,000 good-paying jobs9, but the possibility of critical shortages in construction and craft labor could threaten the timely and successful completion of these projects.10 GSA is committed to scaling the impact of our BIL and other building modernization investments through collaboration with other Federal agencies and our industry partners.   Implement the Good Jobs Initiative partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor to create and support clear pathways for workers to high-quality, good-paying jobs in construction, maintenance, manufacturing, and operations. The actions outlined in the signed Memorandum of Understanding11 aim to support equitable and effective workforce development, including those from nontraditional and underserved labor sources; and improve job quality, standards and metrics on GSA construction sites.   Build and release new Geographic Information System (GIS) data-informed public forecasting resources for BIL and IRA related construction projects. GIS is a computer system that analyzes and displays geographically referenced information. It uses data that is attached to a unique location. By providing more visibility and transparency about where and when Federal projects are happening, GSA can help Federal contractors, trade labor, and community stakeholders effectively plan and better connect with opportunities. This effort will help more Americans, including those from underserved communities, with access to quality employment in their communities. Increase contracting opportunities for socioeconomically disadvantaged small businesses across growing markets in construction, clean energy, and sustainability. GSA will take actions aimed to maximize participation of SDB and build its small business contractor base by improving the forecasting process, strengthening relationships with existing contractors, executing its plans for industry engagement and utilizing the Governmentwide Procurement Equity Tool to identify eligible and new businesses ready to bid for work where GSA projects are located.   Achieve equitable and sustainable development impacts through data-driven insights, Federal partnerships and community engagement. New Federal integrated data mapping and urban planning resources, like the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool have provided GSA with deeper insights about community needs and challenges during the project planning process. This includes opportunities for GSA to collaborate directly with State/local governments and communities on ways to address environmental justice concerns, meet development goals, and scale impact through better and more robust coordination between Federal agencies.   Identify and announce a near-term portfolio of projects for targeted environmental justice and sustainability actions. GSA s Center for Urban Development/Good Neighbor Program will develop a priority list of site repair work at Federal buildings that would correct deficiencies in ways that also bring positive local sustainability impacts, address environmental justice concerns, and fulfill community planning goals. Relevant issues would include stormwater runoff, extreme heat, and tree canopy, as well as accessibility and improving aesthetics. These projects will provide meaningful benefit to the communities surrounding Federal properties and help to maximize the positive 9 Macroeconomic Consequences of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Moody s Analytics (November 2021) 10 Will a labor crunch derail plans to upgrade U.S. infrastructure?, McKinsey & Company (October 2022) 11 General Services Administration - Department of Labor Good Jobs Memorandum of Understanding (2023) 15 U.S. General Services Administration impact of GSA repair investments.   Continue Leveraging the Federal Thriving Communities Network12 to connect GSA stakeholder communities with additional climate and infrastructure resources. While GSA does not issue grants, it can proactively ensure that the communities we serve are better able to connect with place-based technical assistance and other IRA and BIL resources made available through Federal agency partners like U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Department of Commerce.   Complete a study on the impacts of Federal real property disposal. After it is determined that excess real property is no longer needed by the Federal Government, various statutes authorize conveyance13 to State and local governments and in some cases, to nonprofits at up to 100% discount for public benefit use. Some of the qualifying uses include public health, homeless assistance, education, park and recreation, correctional, law enforcement, and emergency management. This study will give GSA important new insights on how portfolio disposal decisions affect surrounding communities in the near and long-term. Measuring Our Progress: Equitable and Sustainable Public Buildings Footprint GSA will know if we are achieving measurable positive impacts in the communities where Federal construction projects and buildings are located by tracking progress against key metrics, including:     increased diversity in the supplier base, including broadened participation from Tribal and disadvantaged businesses contracted to Federal construction projects and increased total dollars awarded to these businesses as a percentage of project value increased number of small and socioeconomic businesses, including new entrants, awarded contracts in the region where Federal projects are located increased number of Project Labor Agreements executed     overall improved job and jobsite quality scores across GSA portfolio projects   increased and more accessible pathways to training and employment opportunities in regions where GSA projects are located increased initiation and execution of community development goals established during Planning Outreach and Partnership engagements     number of GSA community stakeholders who are awarded place-based assistance grants through Thriving Communities opportunities; indicators of reduced burden in disadvantaged Census tracts with GSA environmental justice ameliorations Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Health Equity, Economic Justice, Global Equality Strategy #4: Advance Equity and Effectiveness of Federal Programs Through Rigorous Review, Evaluation and Continuous Improvement Barriers to Equity The Federal Government s exploration of the equitable and effective deployment of benefits, resources and critical relief programs in the near and long term, particularly after national emergencies, is an essential part of how the government performs continuous improvement of 12 https://www.transportation.gov/Federal-interagency-thriving-communities-network 13 https://disposal.gsa.gov/s/PBC 16 U.S. General Services Administration its functions and works better for all Americans. As an example, Federal resources deployed to address immediate needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic faced challenges in equitably reaching communities who were already suffering from legacy disparities in and outcomes across race, class, and geography; these systemic inequities were further exacerbated by the pandemic.14 By conducting more frequent and rigorous evaluation of both the methods used to deliver government resources and the impacts of Federal programs on the public, the Federal Government has the potential to more fully understand if programs are working as intended, better interrupt bias further upstream and modernize systems for greater efficacy   with the ultimate goal of meeting the needs of communities, particularly the most vulnerable, when it matters the most. Undertaking evaluation can be expensive, time consuming, and may require Federal agencies to build capacity for data or research needs before being able to initiate this important work. Additionally, once evaluations are completed, Federal agencies face challenges with resources or infrastructure to act on key findings; and results from evaluations currently lack communication strategies that can more easily raise awareness for the public and catalyze implementation, including across non-Federal stakeholders who also benefit from these insights. Key Actions Complete, publish and share learnings from governmentwide equity evaluations. GSA serves a unique function in the government by providing other Federal agencies with help building and using evidence. We partner with Federal agencies to answer priority questions with rigorous evaluation methods and administrative data. We design and conduct evaluations of existing programs - including life-saving programs like disaster relief, emergency assistance, and crisis hotlines - and recommend evidence-based program changes, with the ultimate goal of improving how the government is serving all Americans.   Increase the number of Federal agencies and programs initiating equity evaluations. GSA currently partners with a handful of Federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Treasury and the U.S. Department of Education. GSA will increase its capacity for new evaluation agreements and work to recruit additional Federal agencies and programs to the service. Additionally, GSA will partner with the White House and interagency councils to bolster Federal agency capacity and readiness to undertake evaluations.   Conduct public engagement and increase awareness of equity evaluation findings. The conclusions and recommendations generated from these evaluation efforts are not only useful to the Federal Government. They provide important insights to State and local governments who coordinate downstream Federal resources to communities and act as a public accountability tool to the communities themselves. GSA will undertake a strategic communications campaign to raise awareness of key findings and ensure the research has maximum impact through its scaled application by end users. Measuring Our Progress: Equitable Administration of Government Programs GSA will know if we are effectively supporting positive change in Federal programs and the equitable delivery of government by several key factors, including:   number of Federal agencies and programs undertaking equity evaluations 14 How COVID-19 Has Magnified Pre-existing Inequalities in the US, Boston University (2022) 17   Number of Federal agencies and programs implementing updates based on findings increased number of people and communities reached by engagement and public   outreach actions about evaluation findings indicators of reduced burden and improved access where Federal program delivery has been revised based on evaluation findings   U.S. General Services Administration Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Economic Justice Strategy #5: Advance Equitable Access to Opportunity and Federal Resources for Local Communities and Minority Serving Institutions Barriers to Equity Rural, socioeconomically underserved, and historically disinvested communities, including Tribes and institutions that serve disadvantaged and minority populations like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), disproportionately rely on Federal goods and services to bridge critical resource gaps.15 Yet barriers to information, administrative burdens in navigating government processes, capacity and infrastructure gaps to meet government requirements, and equitable access to resource pathways prevent communities from fully realizing the available benefits from Federal support and partnership. Key Actions Deliver more Federal goods and products to American communities in critical need through the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program.16 Administered by GSA, the program enables certain non-Federal organizations to obtain personal property that the Federal Government no longer needs. This property includes computers, office equipment and furniture, motor vehicles, aircraft, vessels, scientific devices and heavy machinery. GSA facilitates the distribution of millions of dollars in surplus Federal goods annually and the program is administered in each of the 56 States and territories by a State Agency for Surplus Property (SASP). In addition, State agencies, cities, local governments, Tribal governments, and non-profit organizations for the purposes of public health or education or services to veterans may obtain Federal surplus personal property through the donation program. Examples of recipients of property donations include, but are not limited to: public works departments, public health departments, childcare centers, homeless shelters, school districts, food banks, and HBCUs or other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs).   Establish a plan to conduct proactive reviews for the 56 State Agencies for Surplus Property to ensure their compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with a goal of 14 SASPs for review each fiscal year. GSA s Office of Civil Rights is responsible for GSA s administration of Title VI and will work to increase equitable access to programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance from GSA. Initiate an engagement and outreach plan to raise awareness in local communities about resources available through their State Agency for Surplus Property. GSA   15 Public and Private Investments and Divestments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, American Council on Education (ACE), UNCF (2019) 16 GSA guide: Federal Personal Property for Reuse and Sale 18 will integrate technical assistance and public education about the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program alongside other regular community engagement efforts that the agency coordinates. U.S. General Services Administration Advance procurement opportunities and partnerships between Federal Agencies and Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions. HBCUs and MSIs provide vital support to communities through higher education, cutting edge research, public health ecosystems, pathways to quality employment, and well-being for economically and socially underserved Americans. The Federal Government can better benefit from the deep and rich expertise of these institutions and can improve pathways to more robust and meaningful partnership with them, including through Federal contracting.   Increase the number of eligible HBCUs and MSIs on the GSA Multiple Award Schedule. The MAS is a long-term contract with commercial entities that provides Federal agencies with billions of dollars in annual access to common products and services needed by the government. GSA plans to conduct outreach to eligible institutions currently without MAS contracts, conduct training and provide technical assistance on how to get on the MAS, and host HBCU-focused industry days, matchmaking events and other strategic engagements to raise awareness and help better position HBCUs and MSIs to successfully do business with the Federal Government   Launch and scale adoption of new GSA public digital resource for MSIs. GSA s new public website to support Minority Serving Institutions will aggregate information and resources that help both Federal agencies and MSIs develop and sustain partnerships or contracting agreements. Resources include market research, capabilities assessments, support for exploring joint venture and other contractor team agreements and data tools to help advance supplier diversity across Federal Government procurement Measuring Our Progress: Equitable Access to Federal Resources GSA will know if we are effectively supporting positive change in Federal programs and the equitable delivery of government by several key factors, including:   number of completed civil rights SASP compliance reviews   increased number of people, communities, and MSIs reached by engagement and public outreach actions increased number of underserved communities, organizations, or geographic areas that that seek to participate in the Federal surplus goods program indicators of reduced burden and improved access where program compliance reviews and any required updates have been implemented Increased number of MSI and HBCUs participating in Federal contracts Increased number of overall Federal contracting dollars obligated to MSIs and HBCUs         19",

Background. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins, and has never been hacked. As a result of its scarcity and security, Bitcoin is often referred to as  digital gold . Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The United States Government currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a policy to maximize BTC s strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system. Just as it is in our country s interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United States Digital Asset Stockpile that can serve as a secure account for orderly and strategic management of the United States  other digital asset holdings. Sec. 3. Creation and Administration of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  Stra- tegic Bitcoin Reserve,  capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency (agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to sub- section (d) of this section (Government BTC). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Govern- ment BTC held by it to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. Government BTC deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law. (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  United States Digital Asset Stockpile,  capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Stockpile Assets). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Stockpile Assets held by it to the United States Digital Asset Stockpile and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine strategies for responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile in accordance with applicable law.

However, the United States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other than in connection with crimi- nal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. (d)  Government Digital Assets  means all Government BTC and all Stock- pile Assets. The head of each agency shall not sell or otherwise dispose of any Government Digital Assets, except in connection with the Secretary of the Treasury s exercise of his lawful authority and responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, as required by law, or in cases where the Attorney General or other relevant agency head determines that the Government Digital Assets (or the proceeds from the sale or disposition thereof) can and should: (i) be returned to identifiable and verifiable victims of crime; (ii) be used for law enforcement operations; (iii) be equitably shared with State and local law enforcement partners; or (iv) be released to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705, 28 U.S.C. 524(c), 18 U.S.C. 981, or 21 U.S.C. 881. (e) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment considerations for establishing and managing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile going forward, including the accounts in which the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile should be located and the need for any legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order or the proper management and administration of such accounts. Sec. 4. Accounting. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall provide the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets with a full accounting of all Govern- ment Digital Assets in such agency s possession, including any information regarding the custodial accounts in which such Government Digital Assets are currently held that would be necessary to facilitate a transfer of the Government Digital Assets to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or the United States Digital Asset Stockpile. If such agency holds no Government Digital Assets, such agency shall confirm such fact to the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets within 30 days of the date of this order. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

      "Summary": "Let me analyze these documents and provide a structured summary:\n\n1. Policy Text Summary:\nThe GSA Equity Action Plan is a comprehensive strategy focused on advancing equity across five key areas:\n- Advancing equity in federal procurement\n- Delivering accessible digital government\n- Promoting equity in construction and federal buildings\n- Rigorous program evaluation\n- Expanding access to opportunities for local communities and minority-serving institutions\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nThe Executive Order establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile, managed by the Department of the Treasury. It focuses on consolidating government-owned digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, into centralized accounts with specific guidelines for management and potential use.\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order does NOT directly impact the GSA Equity Action Plan. The policy document is focused on equity across government services, while the executive order is specifically about digital asset management. There are no direct intersections between the two documents that would require immediate policy modifications.\n\n4. Compliance Next Steps:\nAlthough no direct compliance actions are required, GSA might want to:\n- Review any potential implications of digital asset management on procurement strategies\n- Ensure ongoing equity initiatives continue uninterrupted\n- Monitor potential future guidance related to digital assets that might indirectly affect equity goals\n\nRecommendation: No immediate policy changes are necessary. Continue implementing the existing Equity Action Plan strategies.",

      "phase1_response": "## Policy Analysis: GSA Equity Action Plan and Executive Order 14233\n\n### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text\n\nThe GSA Equity Action Plan Updates for 2023 outlines the agency's commitment to delivering equitable, accessible, and inclusive government services. Administrator Robin C. Carnahan emphasizes a people-centered approach to government operations, with GSA playing a key role in investing in American jobs, partnering with industry and labor, delivering digital government services, building sustainability, and strengthening communities. The plan focuses on transforming government through community-centered approaches and leveraging historic federal investments to create meaningful equity impacts across all GSA operations.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text\n\nExecutive Order 14233 establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. The order recognizes Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" due to its capped supply of 21 million coins and security features. It directs the Secretary of the Treasury to create an office to administer custodial accounts for Bitcoin holdings obtained through criminal/civil forfeiture proceedings and civil penalties. The order aims to position the United States strategically in the global digital asset landscape by centralizing management of government-held cryptocurrencies.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of Executive Order Application\n\nThis Executive Order **does not directly apply** to GSA's Equity Action Plan for the following reasons:\n\n**Primary Responsibility**: The Executive Order assigns primary responsibility to the Department of Treasury, not GSA. The Treasury Secretary is tasked with establishing and administering the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\n\n**Scope Limitation**: The order specifically addresses digital asset management and cryptocurrency holdings, while GSA's Equity Action Plan focuses on service delivery, procurement, real estate, and operational equity initiatives.\n\n**Operational Separation**: GSA's core functions (real estate management, procurement, technology services, and administrative support) do not typically involve direct management of forfeited digital assets or cryptocurrency reserves, which fall under Treasury's financial management purview.\n\n**Policy Focus Divergence**: The Equity Action Plan emphasizes community-centered service delivery and inclusive government operations, while the Executive Order addresses strategic financial asset management.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\n\nWhile the Executive Order does not directly impact GSA's Equity Action Plan, GSA should consider the following precautionary measures:\n\n- **Monitor Implementation Guidance**: Stay informed about Treasury's implementation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to identify any potential intersections with GSA operations.\n- **Review Procurement Implications**: Assess whether the Executive Order creates any new procurement requirements for digital asset management services that GSA might need to facilitate.\n- **Coordinate with Treasury**: Maintain communication channels with Treasury to ensure GSA can provide any administrative or technological support if requested.\n- **Continue Equity Plan Implementation**: Proceed with existing Equity Action Plan initiatives as they remain unaffected by this Executive Order.\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",
      "phase2_flag": "Not Affected",
      "phase2_justification": "**\n\n1. **Policy Subject Area**: The GSA Equity Action Plan operates in the domain of social equity, focusing on ensuring government services are accessible, inclusive, and equitable for all citizens regardless of background or demographic characteristics.\n\n2. **Executive Order Subject Area**: EO 14233 operates in the financial/monetary policy domain, specifically addressing cryptocurrency reserves and digital asset strategy as a matter of national economic positioning.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact between these domains. The establishment of a bitcoin reserve does not:\n   - Alter funding mechanisms for equity programs\n   - Change service delivery requirements or standards\n   - Modify accessibility or inclusion mandates\n   - Create new equity cons",
      "phase2_response": "**Step 1: Policy Domain Identification**\nThe policy is focused on **equity, accessibility, and inclusive government services**. The GSA Equity Action Plan centers on delivering equitable, accessible, and inclusive government services to ensure that government works for everyone, with a people-centered approach to service delivery.\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain Identification**\nThe executive order is focused on **cryptocurrency/digital asset policy and financial reserve management**. EO 14233 establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and addresses the United States' position in digital asset holdings as a strategic financial matter.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nThese are fundamentally different policy domains:\n- **Policy Domain**: Social equity and inclusive government service delivery\n- **EO Domain**: Digital asset/cryptocurrency financial strategy\n\nThere is no direct operational or programmatic connection between establishing a bitcoin reserve and implementing equity action plans for government service delivery. The EO does not modify, restrict, or enhance GSA's equity initiatives, nor does it create new equity considerations that would affect the Equity Action Plan's implementation.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment**\nWhile the phase1_flag indicates \"Not Affected,\" my independent analysis confirms this assessment. The executive order's focus on digital asset reserves is entirely separate from equity and inclusion initiatives in government service delivery.\n\n**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Subject Area**: The GSA Equity Action Plan operates in the domain of social equity, focusing on ensuring government services are accessible, inclusive, and equitable for all citizens regardless of background or demographic characteristics.\n\n2. **Executive Order Subject Area**: EO 14233 operates in the financial/monetary policy domain, specifically addressing cryptocurrency reserves and digital asset strategy as a matter of national economic positioning.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact between these domains. The establishment of a bitcoin reserve does not:\n   - Alter funding mechanisms for equity programs\n   - Change service delivery requirements or standards\n   - Modify accessibility or inclusion mandates\n   - Create new equity considerations for GSA operations\n   - Affect the people-centered approach to government services\n\n4. **Supporting Language**: The EO focuses entirely on \"strategic advantage,\" \"store of value,\" and \"global financial system\" positioning, while the policy emphasizes \"equitable, accessible, and inclusive\" service delivery and \"people-centered approach to government.\"\n\n5. **Edge Cases Considered**: Even considering potential indirect effects (such as resource allocation or administrative priorities), the bitcoin reserve establishment operates at a macro-financial level that does not intersect with GSA's service delivery equity initiatives. The domains remain functionally separate with no meaningful policy overlap.\n\nThe executive order and equity action plan address entirely different governmental functions and objectives, confirming the \"Not Affected\" determination.",

Since 1994, the DE Program has overseen GSA s commitment to expert-informed decision making, ensuring that the agency s investments incorporate best practices in building performance, community engagement, project management, and myriad other categories. DE s comprehensive approach to delivering best customer value has consistently achieved superior quality on time, on budget, and within scope. Following on, the successful integration of the DE Program in federally owned new construction and major modernizations, in 2001 GSA extended the DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 2 of 22 program s policies and procedures to certain lease acquisitions involving new building construction. The agency launched the Design Excellence in Leasing Program (DE-Leasing) and published an accompanying Design Excellence in Leasing Guide. This Design Excellence in Leasing Program Guidance (DEL-PG) updates and replaces the 2001 Design Excellence in Leasing Guide. It provides a framework for applying DE to certain lease procurements specifically Lease Construction, which is described as new building construction lease acquisitions where the Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) mandates new building construction. Lease Construction is fully defined in Chapter 14 of the PBS Leasing Desk Guide (LDG). The DEL-PG outlines the up to date best practices for integrating DE methods into qualifying projects  delivery. This guidance identifies program strategies and resources that maximize a project s benefits from its outset. It also shows how to engage agency customers and other stakeholders in a productive project dialogue, because good design welcomes maximum collaboration-which in turn fosters innovation. Guidance highlights include:     An overall process for incorporating DE into lease acquisitions involving new building construction (i.e., Lease Construction as described in this document). Information concerning project requirements and kickoff meetings, which support the definition of a project and its team members  roles.   Procedures for assembling and utilizing design reviewers effectively.   Strategies for overseeing and championing design quality pre- and -post lease award. PROGRAM OVERVIEW - 1 GSA s DE-Leasing program establishes nationwide policies and procedures for selecting the most suitable design teams for Lease Construction projects. The DE-Leasing process of reviewing submissions from offerors and their associated Architect/Engineer (A/E) firms and their lead designers ensures that projects utilize the design services of high-quality design teams. The program is also dedicated to facilitating those teams  best work:   Establishing milestones when key collaborators can synchronize DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 3 of 22 project understanding and coordinate tasks.   Means and methods for producing high-quality, high-performance facilities.   Assuring that architecture, urban design, landscape architecture, interior design, engineering, historic preservation, construction, security, sustainability, and workplace design knowledge of the Office of the Chief Architect - based Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) is appropriately integrated.   Facilitating collaboration between the leasing community and Chief Architects or designee, so that applicable leasing projects embrace a culture of quality design.   Should a region encounter Market Driven construction, first consult with the Office of Leasing for further guidance DE-Leasing shall be included in leases for lease construction as outlined more thoroughly in LDG Chapter 14. While Lease Construction represents a small percentage of GSA s lease acquisitions, there are instances when lease construction best meets customer needs. In turn, DE-Leasing creates a platform for GSA s Chief Architect or designee, SMEs, PMs, Leasing Contracting Officers (LCOs), and Leasing Specialists (LSs) to share best practices and uncover opportunities for maximizing taxpayer value. The program is a commitment to providing customer agencies with fiscally and environmentally responsible space, which creates a positive impression of the Federal Government. This DEL-PG instructs the project manager (PM) or Leasing Specialist (LS) to work with the Chief Architect) or designee to develop project specific DE requirements, as necessary. The Chief Architect or designee, will work with the project team to integrate DE principles into Lease Construction projects utilizing existing program resources and coordinate with the Chief Architect or designee as necessary. Irrespective of size or type, all Lease Construction projects require Chief Architect or designee guidance from their inception. As soon as Lease Construction has been determined, the Chief Architect or designee must be contacted by the PM and included as members of the leasing project team. The Chief Architect or designee membership in the project team ensures that a project appropriately integrates proven strategies for design quality. The Office of the Chief Architect, the Office of Leasing, the Office of Portfolio Management, and related programs collaborate regularly to deliver the best value for the American taxpayer. By articulating the partnership between the Chief Architect or designee and the leasing project team, this DEL-PG maximizes participation among all in-house experts and key stakeholders. DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 4 of 22 Department of Transportation Headquarters, Washington DC PROJECT PLANNING - 2 This section articulates the components of GSA s DE-Leasing process for Lease Construction. While modifications and adjustments of the process are permissible to address local/regional practices and procedures as necessary, DE- Leasing essentially comprises four steps:   Needs Assessment and Requirements Development   Develop and issue the RLP, including source selection criteria   Review and evaluate design submittals   Post-award design evaluation NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPMENT FOR LEASE CONSTRUCTION ONLY Before commencing the project, all key stakeholders must have a thorough is best understanding of the agency s needs and requirements. This accomplished with clear requirements that may information concerning agency goals and objectives, staff and support space, adjacency needs, workspace standards and allocations, and technical room and space requirements. At a minimum, the PM should discuss these issues with the customer agency and the LCO, who thereafter must identify the requirements include DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 5 of 22 within the RLP. For Lease Construction projects, PMs should reach out to the Chief Architect or designee for guidance in determining the applicability of DE-Leasing. Preferably, the entire project team should also convene a kickoff session to clarify the following elements of design integration:   Goals and vision   Community visibility and importance   Design opportunities and criteria   Agency needs and requirements   Budget and schedule   Roles and responsibilities of the project team   Schedule and time constraints   Existing market options and opportunities NEXT STEPS Many opportunities to improve design and construction quality arise during a project s needs assessment phase and beyond. Leasing project teams should work with the Chief Architect or designee to identify different points along the lease acquisition timeline to leverage resources and maximize a project s potential. The Chief Architect or designee tailor quality assurance opportunities to the project s building type, scope, and budget while focusing on the following milestones. Advertisement - When lease construction is the known course of action, engagement with the Chief Architect or designee during this phase facilitates proper inclusion of potential DE-Leasing language in advertisements posted on BetaSAM/SAM or alternative Governmentwide point of entry (GPEs) and similar resources. Determining Approach - DE-Leasing creates collaboration between DE- Leasing representatives and the leasing project team for Lease Construction. For these projects, the Chief Architect or designee shall provide technical input and guidance in the development of DE-Leasing Source Selection evaluation factors for the RLP, Lease, and any associated documents to support an award determination. The Chief Architect or designee participates in design evaluations and, depending upon project complexity, the Chief Architect or designee may nominate staff experts, and Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) A/E contractors to act as technical advisors to the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB). (See LDG Chapter 2, LDG Chapter 13, and LDG Chapter 14). Requirements Development - GSA s successful delivery of space depends on DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 6 of 22 shared understanding of customer requirements. The process of identifying a customer agency s strategic, functional, and technical requirements is the first step in agency delivery. Note that, while some customer agencies may have well established, highly developed requirements, others may have a Program of Requirements (POR) that requires GSA validation. DE-Leasing should also be discussed with the customer agency during this phase, and in applicable cases the PM should consult with the Chief Architect or designee to gather the strategic and technical requirements. Requirements Package   The requirements package is typically a compilation of several separate documents, forms, or other attachments that contain the detailed information necessary to produce a well crafted RLP and executed lease. The package details the DE-Leasing features and processes specific to a project. Further, it is important to understand the distinction between an agency s special requirements versus its preferences, which could be used as award factors in the procurement (e.g., 50-foot building setback required versus a 200-foot setback requested). (See the LDG for more information.) Post Award Kick-off Meeting- After award, GSA will meet with the Lessor s A/E and lead designer to convey the basis of design as outlined in the RLP. Design Intent Drawings (DID) - As a member of the leasing project team, the Chief Architect or designee provides input and guidance during the DID phase for any Lease Construction project. Design Phases - The Chief Architect or designee (or appropriate designee) participates in reviews of the following activities: schematic design; design development, and final design phases. DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 7 of 22 EPA Potomac Yards One, Arlington, VA DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 8 of 22 LEASING POLICY & GUIDANCE IMPACTING DESIGN - 3 THE LEASING DESK GUIDE (LDG) The LDG is the primary policy and lease acquisition guidance reference for real property lease acquisitions. It contains authorities, policies, technical and procedural guidance and administrative limitations governing lease acquisition. Office of Leasing professionals follow policies as they are updated or canceled via LDG revisions, Leasing Alerts, or Lease Acquisition Circulars. The LDG provides DE-Leasing guidance in the following chapters:   Chapter 1 - Requirements Development   Chapter 2 - New or Replacing Lease Acquisitions   Chapter 13 - Source Selection in Leasing   Chapter 14 - Lease Acquisitions Involving New Building Construction (Otherwise referred to as Lease Construction) As first noted in Section 1 of this document, DE-Leasing must be applied whenever the RLP specifies Lease Construction. RLPs for Lease Construction must also allow Best Value Tradeoff (BVTO); DE-Leasing is not intended for RLPs that employ a lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection. NEW BUILDING/LEASE CONSTRUCTION IN LEASING Due to the various complexities inherent to lease construction, detailed guidance ensures proper implementation of policies and processes for all scenarios. The Chief Architect or designee should familiarize themselves with the LDG, while all DE-Leasing stakeholders should understand the following leasing definitions, key terms, and concepts at a minimum. Lease Construction is more thoroughly defined in LDG Chapter-14. Lease Construction is a leasing solution when the Government mandates that only new building construction can meet its technical requirements. Such mandates are rare, issued typically when the existing market lacks highly unique (specialized) space. Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service (PBS-P100) establishes design standards and criteria for Lease Construction facilities, but only when GSA s formal RLP includes a purchase option for GSA to acquire the building at a future date determined jointly by the Office of the Chief Architect and the Office of Leasing. (See LDG Chapter-14 to learn about purchase options in detail). DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 9 of 22 RLP & LEASE CONTENT In cases of Lease Construction where DE-Leasing is incorporated, the LCO will work with the Chief Architect or designee to develop source selection evaluation factors and criteria and to review technical requirements as necessary. The RLP package includes the source selection factors and minimum requirements for lease negotiation. The RLP must describe expectations and scope that inform offerors of what to include in their proposal, as well as the factors by which proposals will be evaluated. Drafting the RLP is a critical part of any lease procurement. The process of drafting an RLP package for Lease Construction projects contains complexities discussed in the LDG. The current version of the RLP and lease documents are available on the National Office of Leasing Google site and on GSA.gov. If DE- Leasing is used, then the RLP source selection methodology must be written for a BVTO. SOURCE SELECTION The term source selection refers to selecting a source or sources as outlined in Part 570 of the General Services Administration Acquisition Manual. Source selection includes both the LPTA and BVTO processes. For additional information on source selection in leasing, refer to LDG Chapters 2, 13, and 14. If BVTO is used for a lease project that involves DE-Leasing, then there are two methods typically attributable to this process:   Single Phase - BVTO   Two Phase Design Build - BVTO Both are appropriate when an award to other than the lowest price offeror, or to the highest technically rated offeror, is the best option for the government. SINGLE PHASE - BVTO BVTO prioritizes design and designer qualifications in source selection. While it can be applied to all procurements, it should be used when technical factors are equal to or more important than price. This approach allows the Federal Government to specify certain award factors to evaluate offers beyond simply determining whether they meet the RLP s requirements; an award may be made to an offer that is higher than the lowest priced offer when that offer provides substantially more value to the Government based on the stated evaluation criteria. Single Phase BVTO employs technical award factors, with the relative ranking DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 10 of 22 and weights to help determine the successful awardee. Past performance and price must be included as award factors. The importance of the overall technical proposal to price must also be determined (e.g., substantially greater than, approximately equal to, or substantially less than price) prior to issuance of the RLP. Based on this methodology, the RLP must require offerors  design team qualifications to be submitted for review and evaluation, specifying a level of past performance information commensurate with the size, cost, and function of the procurement. The RLP may also require the initial offer submission to include interior and exterior elevations and perspectives, as well as documentation of site conditions, building positioning, views, open space information, access, setbacks, landscape design, and other important design considerations. TWO PHASE DESIGN BUILD Two-Phase Design Build BVTO is the tradeoff method that should be used when the leasing project team knows that the project will require new building construction and when customer agency requirements are well defined. It incorporates a high level of requirements for site and facility design and for the qualifications of the A/E and lead designer. Two Phase Design Build BVTO applies to lease construction that is anticipated to have a significant presence. Significant presence is associated with buildings that occupy prominent locations, that generate a high level of public traffic, and which are considered politically sensitive or highly visible. The nature of the project s surroundings can also create a significant presence. This is the case with border installations or any project that makes the building the only federally leased building, or one of few federally leased buildings, in the area. Two Phase Design Build BVTO is also appropriate in cases where the Federal Government acquires or works with a developer to acquire a site. The RLP should require the first-phase submission to include the offerors  design team qualifications (A/E firm as well as lead designer s qualifications), the offeror and design team s past performance, and site and building orientation (identifying both ingress and egress to the site). The second phase submission should include both interior and exterior elevations and perspectives, as well as documentation on site conditions, building positioning, views, open space information, access, setbacks, landscaping and other important design features. (At a minimum, interior elevations must depict common areas that include public lobby, elevator lobbies, and other spaces that include, but are not limited to, stacked infrastructural rooms. Offerors must also include other interior drawings that include, but are not limited to, a typical floor plan, typical office layout, roof plan, etc. These determinations will be made by the leasing project team in close collaboration with the Chief Architect or designee.) DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 11 of 22 The Chief Architect or designee plays a significant role in the development of the design criteria and technical evaluation factors for lease construction source selection. The Chief Architect or designee may be a voting member of the SSEB, and the Chief Architect or designee are available to offer guidance to the LCO. The SSEB will evaluate site and facility designs. The Source Selection Plan (SSP) provides guidance for developing the RLP, identifying evaluation factors and methods used in evaluating proposals. The LCO works with the leasing project team to develop the SSP and receives technical assistance from the SSEB in such development. The SSEB should review the SSP before the presolicitation conference and before RLP issuance. FEMA Headquarters, Winchester, VA DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 12 of 22 SOURCE SELECTION IN FURTHER DETAIL - 4 After the determination of a Single Phase BVTO or Two- Phase Design Build BVTO for procurement, the Chief Architect or designee shall work with the LCO to develop evaluation factors and design requirements for the RLP and SSP. EVALUATION FACTORS AND REQUIREMENTS Evaluation factors may include, but are not limited to site, design, and offeror/team qualifications. The RLP will define the minimum requirements for each evaluation factor. In addition to the minimum RLP requirements, important evaluation factors affecting the building design need to be evaluated. These may include:   How the site supports program requirements (i.e., capacity, expansion)   Zoning and anticipated usage.   Site ownership and/or control.   Environmental and regulatory compliance.   A/E firm and lead designer s completion of projects of similar size and complexity.   Capacity of surrounding infrastructure, e.g., transportation, roads, utilities.   Surrounding amenities, e.g., shops, childcare, food service, hospitality, etc.   Ability of the facility s design and layout to support customer s operational requirements.   Other minimum requirements as stated in the RLP. Design requirements are typically tailored to the needs of the project. They are based on the level of design required pre- or post-award and extent of designer qualifications. A/E FIRM AND LEAD DESIGNER S QUALIFICATIONS An offeror s entire design team must demonstrate its ability to satisfy the comprehensive project development and management requirements of the RLP. The qualifications information submitted by offerors can be basic or extensive; such breadth depends on the level and complexity of the project. This information encompasses both experience and past performance. Experience refers to offeror-submitted information about completed projects, whereas past performance is gathered via checks of references provided by the offeror on how well those projects were completed. DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 13 of 22 Commented [2]: correct formatting Design Philosophy and Approach of the lead designer is one other factor to be evaluated as part of the RLP process. Evaluation of design philosophy and approach may include, but are not limited the following elements:   Understanding of the Government s requirements.   Demonstration of creativity and innovation in meeting those requirements.   Balancing design with budget limitations.   Integration of the site and surrounding environment.   Application of current sustainability and energy-efficiency requirements. Evaluation of the lead designer s experience, includes, but is not limited to: successful completion of at least three projects similar in size, complexity, and scope in the last 10 years. Evaluation of Past Performance is based on reference checks of the offeror and key personnel (i.e. the A/E and Lead Designer) when requested although there are cases in which SSEBs have specified reference checks for entities such as the offeror s project manager and general contractor. Past performance reference checks are not a guarantee of future design quality. The past performance should evaluate the design portfolio of the A/E firm and lead designer in terms of:   Cost control   Timeliness of performance   Business relations   Technical quality of the service performed   Small business subcontracting DESIGN SUBMITTAL REVIEW AND EVALUATION SSEB s typically evaluates A/E and lead designer s qualifications, as well as design teams , site and design analyses. In addition, design evaluation criteria are identified, defined, and communicated to offerors in the RLP. Examples of design evaluation criteria may include:   Ease of accessibility (e.g., curb cuts, condition of route).   Weather protection (covered and climate-controlled areas).   Visual and physical security.   Building efficiency (RU factor).   Floor plate efficiency (RU factor).   Building form supports the function of the tenant agency, (e.g., space allocations reflect the documented needs of occupants).   Building form expresses the mission and goals of the tenant agency. DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 14 of 22   Workspace quality: team areas, open/closed offices.   Finished ceiling height in feet.   Percent of glazing on the building envelope   Percent of exterior obstructed by adjacent buildings. Commented [3]: fix bullet   Percent of floor plate that is no more than 50 feet from natural light source.   Lease span depth in feet.   Sustainability POST-AWARD DESIGN ACTIVITIES Depending on the procurement method used, the level of design completed prior to lease award varies significantly. Defining the post-award design process and other design activities is therefore a fundamental task of a leasing project team. The team s description must encompass design, construction documents, and construction/refurbishment. It must also specify the number and type of design reviews, topics, and designated decision makers, along with specific outcomes and objectives of each review session. The input of the team s Chief Architect or designee is fundamental to this effort. After a lease award, the PM should conduct a Post Award Kickoff meeting with the successful offeror to define the roles, scope, and authority for the project s design process. The customer agency must be present at this meeting, while the offeror s representatives, PM, LCO, PBS Office of Facility Management representative, Chief Architect or designee, and any other necessary participants should attend, as well. The Chief Architect or designee shall continue to play a significant role in the design process after lease award, because achieving a successful, well-designed building is an ongoing process. Management of the detailed design, construction, build-out, and occupancy of the new leased space should abide by the terms that the leasing project team defines in the RLP and Lease Agreement.

When it is known that Lease Construction will be the approved lease acquisition direction, the PM or LCO will engage the Chief Architect or designee as a member of the project team. The project team also includes the LS and subject matter experts representing architecture, engineering, interior design and other subject matter experts as necessary. The Office of Leasing assists federal agencies in accomplishing their mission by providing lease acquisition services that deliver space on time, at the best value, and with superior solutions. The Regional Leasing Office determines the project lead for a Lease Construction project. The designated project lead (the PM, LCO, or LS) will engage the Chief Architect or designee on all new building construction lease projects. Project Managers (PMs) oversee management of the most complex projects. They have overall project-management responsibility for assigned projects from preliminary identification through initiation, planning, execution, and project- closeout stages. The PM s broad managerial responsibilities encompass planning and requirements development, as well as organizing, controlling, coordinating, reviewing, and approving design, construction, project delivery, and related work. The PM shepherds a project to implementation, and serves as a key resource during all stages of execution. If there is a PM assigned to a project, then the LCO becomes a team member on the leasing project team. Whether the PM or LCO serves as the project lead, that person must contact the Chief Architect or designee early in a Lease Construction project s development process. The Leasing Contracting Officer (LCO) has exclusive authority to enter into, amend, and administer leases on the Government s behalf to the extent provided in his or her certificate of appointment as a contracting officer. The LCO safeguards the interests of the United States in its lease acquisition program, processes, and policies. The Leasing Specialist (LS) assists the LCO and may perform duties that do not legally obligate the Government. GSA has established guidelines regarding the issues that a LS must consider when allocating resources to support the design, construction, and project management phases of projects (e.g., size, complexity, availability of local GSA associates, and/or IDIQ DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 17 of 22 contractors). The Office of Design and Construction, which includes the Office of the Chief Architect and the Office of Project Delivery, provides national leadership in design and construction expertise. in architecture, engineering, and construction project management support GSA s regional offices coordinating policies, procedures, initiatives, and sharing best practices. Its trusted experts The Chief Architect, in coordination with Regional Chief Architects (RCA s) and DE-Leasing National Program Director, oversees GSA's implementation of the national DE Program and partners with the Office of Leasing concerning implementation of DE-Leasing. The Chief Architect represents agency-wide standards of quality through multiple programs that include DE. The DE-Leasing National Program Director (DE-LNPD) is the Central Office- based Design Excellence point of contact to the GSA regions through the RCA s. The DE-LNPD ensures that GSA s national design policy is applied to regional projects. The DE-LNPD supports the integration of DE-Leasing into projects. Depending upon project complexity, the DE-LNPD may offer suggestions for Central Office SMEs to act as advisors to the SSEB. The DE-LNPD is a key resource in the design approach. The DE-LNPD, upon RCA request, may also contribute to requirements development and any post award design issues that may arise. Regional Chief Architect s (RCA) are the DE point of contact to the GSA Regions. The RCA ensures that GSA s national design policy is applied to regional projects, by engaging with Lease Construction projects from initial scoping and kickoff through the design development phase and/or early construction documents. The RCA may be designated as a project team member for all Lease Construction projects in their specific region. The RCA supports the integration of DE-Leasing into projects by: providing design submittal criteria for the LCO to use in the evaluation factors; reviewing proposed RLP content related to design and participating in design submittal evaluations. Depending upon project complexity, the RCA may offer suggestions for Regional SME s to act as advisors to the SSEB. RCA s are a key resource in procurement and design approach for A/E selection and design review. RCA involvement may not be limited to the project s initial design phase. These team members may also contribute to requirements development and any post award design issues that may arise. Subject Matter Experts (SME s) provide expertise that helps define customer agency requirements and facilitates projects. They may also participate in DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 18 of 22 market surveys, reviews of tenant improvement (TI) costs, design, build-outs, and construction inspections in summary, these GSA staff experts draw on their specialized knowledge to assist the whole lease acquisition process. SMEs  knowledge areas include, but are not limited to accessibility, DE-Leasing policies and procedures, engineering, fire and life safety, historic preservation, sustainability, and workplace design. Regional Workplace Executives (RWE s) are another resource internal to GSA, as they work in concert with the Chief Architect or designee to support the leasing project team as necessary. RWE specialties include interior space design, procurement approach, DID (design intent drawings), and design review for TIs. RWEs partner with stakeholders to create customized workplace programs, which focus on mobile strategies and flexible environments that help agencies meet their business, sustainability, and real estate goals. NOAA Center for Weather Prediction, Riverdale, MD DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 19 of 22 APPENDIX   2 DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE TO DE- LEASING Acquisition Plan - All leases, regardless of dollar value, require acquisition planning. Leases over the Simplified Lease Acquisition Threshold (SLAT) must have a written acquisition plan approved at the appropriate level. The acquisition plan must be finalized before issuing the RLP. - The Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) is the primary law that ensures federal facilities are accessible to people with disabilities. It is required to be implemented in all new building construction leases, for which ABAAS serves as the standards document. (ABAAS) Best Value Tradeoff (BVTO) - The source selection process that permits tradeoffs among price and technical factors, allowing the Government to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror or the highest technically rated offeror (see FAR 15.101-1). In a BVTO procurement, the LCO must include price or cost to the Government, past performance, the planned participation of small disadvantaged business concerns in performance of the contract, and other factors as required by FAR 15.304 as evaluation factors. The contracting officer may include other evaluation factors as needed. Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) - The source selection process that selects the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price (see FAR 15.101-2). New or Replacing Leases - Leases with new terms and conditions and new lease contract numbers applicable for either a new requirement or to replace an existing expiring lease. PBS Leasing Desk Guide (LDG) - A comprehensive leasing guidance compilation which contains authorities, policies, technical and procedural guidance, and administrative limitations governing the acquisition for the leasing of real property. Peer Review - The pre- or post-award review of designs by the Chief Architect or designee all of whom serve as adjudicators, design advocates, and consensus builders for DE. Peer review during solicitation may involve team interviews, reference checks, and portfolio evaluation. Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) - The team of Government employees (not contractors) appointed by the Source Selection Authority DESIGN EXCELLENCE IN LEASING PROGRAM GUIDANCE 2021 20 of 22 (SSA) to assist in a negotiated acquisition when using the Best Value Tradeoff process. The board typically consists of a chairperson, technical (non-voting) members and voting members, the Lease Contracting Officer, and a legal advisor. The customer agency may be represented on the SSEB in either a voting or non-voting capacity. The SSEB s design reviewers will include the Chief Architect or designee.

Policy. American citizens deserve an excellent and efficient Federal workforce that attracts the highest caliber of civil servants committed to achieving the freedom, prosperity, and democratic rule that our Constitution promotes. But current Federal hiring practices are broken, insular, and out- dated. They no longer focus on merit, practical skill, and dedication to our Constitution. Federal hiring should not be based on impermissible factors, such as one s commitment to illegal racial discrimination under the guise of  equity,  or one s commitment to the invented concept of  gender iden- tity  over sex. Inserting such factors into the hiring process subverts the will of the People, puts critical government functions at risk, and risks losing the best-qualified candidates. By making our recruitment and hiring processes more efficient and focused on serving the Nation, we will ensure that the Federal workforce is prepared to help achieve American greatness, and attracts the talent necessary to serve our citizens effectively. By significantly improving hiring principles and practices, Americans will receive the Federal resources and services they deserve from the highest-skilled Federal workforce in the world. Sec. 2. Federal Hiring Plan. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the Administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), shall develop and send to agency heads a Federal Hiring Plan that brings to the Federal workforce only highly skilled Americans dedicated to the furtherance of American ideals, values, and interests. (b) This Federal Hiring Plan shall: (i) prioritize recruitment of individuals committed to improving the effi- ciency of the Federal government, passionate about the ideals of our American republic, and committed to upholding the rule of law and the United States Constitution; (ii) prevent the hiring of individuals based on their race, sex, or religion, and prevent the hiring of individuals who are unwilling to defend the Constitution or to faithfully serve the Executive Branch; (iii) implement, to the greatest extent possible, technical and alternative assessments as required by the Chance to Compete Act of 2024; (iv) decrease government-wide time-to-hire to under 80 days; (v) improve communication with candidates to provide greater clarity regarding application status, timelines, and feedback, including regular updates on the progress of applications and explanations of hiring decisions where appropriate; (vi) integrate modern technology to support the recruitment and selection process, including the use of data analytics to identify trends, gaps, and VerDate Sep<11>2014 18:45 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE9.SGM 30JAE9 5 1 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l 8622 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents opportunities in hiring, as well as leveraging digital platforms to improve candidate engagement; and (vii) ensure Department and Agency leadership, or their designees, are active participants in implementing the new processes and throughout the full hiring process.

      "phase1_response": "## Policy Analysis: Design Excellence in Leasing Program Guidance vs. Executive Order 14170\n\n### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text\n\nThe Design Excellence in Leasing Program Guidance (DE-LPG) 2021 is a GSA policy document that establishes frameworks and procedures for applying design excellence principles to certain lease procurements, specifically \"Lease Construction\" involving new building construction. The policy updates the 2001 guidance and ensures expert-informed decision-making in design, construction, and project delivery processes for leased federal facilities. It focuses on delivering best customer value through superior quality outcomes that are on time, on budget, and within scope.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text\n\nExecutive Order 14170, issued January 20, 2025, aims to reform federal hiring processes by focusing on merit-based selection. The order explicitly prohibits consideration of factors such as commitment to \"equity\" (characterized as illegal racial discrimination) and \"gender identity\" concepts in hiring decisions. It mandates the development of a Federal Hiring Plan within 120 days, involving the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, OMB Director, OPM Director, and the Administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability\n\n**The executive order does NOT directly apply to the DE-LPG policy.** Here's the detailed analysis:\n\n**Scope Mismatch:**\n- The executive order specifically targets federal hiring processes and personnel selection\n- The DE-LPG policy addresses project delivery, design standards, and procurement procedures for leased facilities\n- These are fundamentally different operational domains\n\n**Subject Matter Distinction:**\n- Executive Order 14170 focuses on human resources practices and civil service recruitment\n- DE-LPG focuses on real estate transactions, design excellence standards, and construction project management\n- No overlap exists in the core subject matters\n\n**Implementation Realm:**\n- The executive order affects HR departments and hiring managers\n- DE-LPG affects real estate professionals, project managers, and design teams\n- Different GSA divisions would implement these respective policies\n\n**Potential Indirect Considerations:**\nWhile the core DE-LPG policy remains unaffected, any future updates to the guidance should ensure that if personnel selection criteria are incorporated (such as for design review panels or consultant selection), those criteria align with merit-based principles outlined in the executive order.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nSince the policy is not directly affected, no immediate compliance actions are required for the DE-LPG itself. However, GSA should consider these precautionary measures:\n\n- **Monitoring:** Stay alert for any future executive orders or implementing guidance that might affect procurement or project delivery policies\n- **Review Protocols:** If the DE-LPG is updated in the future, ensure any personnel-related provisions align with federal hiring reform principles\n- **Documentation:** Maintain awareness that related policies involving contractor selection or consultant evaluation should comply with merit-based criteria\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

The policy's substantive requirements (design standards, leasing procedures, performance criteria) remain completely independent of hiring process changes. Personnel changes might affect implementation capacity but do not alter the policy's substantive content or requirements.\n\nThe domains are sufficiently distinct that federal hiring reform has no meaningful bearing on real estate leasing guidance.",

Carnahan The General Services Administration s overarching goal is delivering efficient, effective government for the American people. As we look to the future, we re codifying another element into that goal: equity. The sacred trust between government and its citizens should inform every action, every decision, and every policy. It s our responsibility to get people the services they need, when they need them   that s why we re taking a people-centered approach to government. We know that government only works when it works for everyone, so I m proud to renew GSA s commitment to delivering a government that s equitable, accessible, and inclusive of the diverse nation we serve. GSA has a big role to play in fulfilling the mission of government, whether we re investing in American jobs, partnering with American industry and trade labor, delivering digital government with good customer experience, building a more sustainable future, or bolstering the strength of communities across the country. In all this, we re committed to making meaningful equity impacts, recognizing that equitable approaches lead to better outcomes for everyone. That s why our Equity Action Plan is so important. The heart of this plan is community and it provides us with ways we can both transform government in the long-term and ensure that what the government delivers has meaningful impacts on the daily lives of people all across the country. The good news is that we have the money and the momentum to make these kinds of impacts real. From Day One, the President has been focused on Investing in America   in our people, in our infrastructure, and in rebuilding our economy through historic, once-in-a-generation investments. I ve been out on the road a lot this year and I ve seen these strategies in action firsthand. To start, with over $6 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, we re making smart investments in GSA-controlled Federal buildings all across the country. We re focused on building spaces that are part of the communities they inhabit, modernizing them so they can easily provide services to the American people, and ensuring their resilience and sustainability. With every investment, we re seeking to address climate change because it s a triple win: creating good jobs, saving taxpayer dollars, and making a healthier future for generations to come. We know that historically underserved communities are too-often disproportionately impacted by climate change, so we re making sure that this triple win benefits everyone. 1 U.S. General Services Administration From Arizona to Ohio, I ve heard from workers that are proud to be part of this national transformation and that they see the benefits to their families, their communities, and American businesses. I ve met with trade labor unions, workers, and leaders in the building and construction industry, all of whom have shared with me how they re committed to these same goals. They re recruiting more women and people of color and training them in the tools and technologies we need to implement billions of dollars in investments. They know what we know: these investments will create pathways to the middle-class, strengthen communities across the country, and build a stronger and more prosperous future for everyone. At our federal buildings, we ve been partnering with local small businesses to guide them through the process of accessing opportunities across the Federal marketplace. We ve also been partnering with opportunity centers to raise awareness of these projects among the local communities. There s one location in D.C. where we ve helped over 35 businesses get onto government schedules and helped secure jobs for over 2,500 people. We re also focused on the physical accessibility of our buildings through our National Accessibility Program, the many efforts of our Office of Design and Construction, and our long-standing relationship with the U.S. Access Board. We also partnered with Challenge.gov to launch the  Access for All  universal and accessible design competition for U.S. architecture students to source best practice improvements. As the caretaker of the nation s largest public art collection, we ve preserved and expanded the people s collection over the last 50 years, placing art in Federal buildings and public spaces that tells the story of our nation and our democracy. We re committed to expanding opportunities for new artists to contribute, creating jobs while ensuring that the diversity and vibrancy of our portfolio reflects the diversity and vibrancy of the American story. Our Federal Acquisition Service and Office of Small & Disadvantaged Business Utilization are committed to making it easier for businesses to succeed in the Federal marketplace. From forecasting tools and new identifiers for a diverse range of businesses to training and outreach programs, we re actively expanding our supplier diversity, reducing barriers, and improving outcomes. In fact, GSA awarded more than $3.3 billion to small businesses, which represents over 50% of the agency's FY23 eligible spending, according to data current as of November 2, 2023. GSA s work delivering  services that are simple to use, accessible, equitable, protective, transparent, and responsive for all people  is evident in our digital capabilities as well. Our public-facing websites are 508 compliant, support assistive technology, and are available in multiple languages. In fact, Vote.gov has recently added its first Alaska Native language and multiple Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander languages to increase accessibility while supporting cultural vitality. We re also 2 U.S. General Services Administration engaging in equity studies across our Technology Transformation Services to ensure that we re providing human-centered tools that meet the needs of every American. We ve been partnering across the government as well. Our Office of Government-wide Policy IT Accessibility team helps agencies meet Federal compliance standards while our U.S. Web Design Services offers toolkits and best practices to ensure that Federal websites are accessible for everyone   that includes providing specific resources to support customers in varying socio-economic communities. Through our work with the Department of Labor s Good Jobs Initiative, we re helping improve job quality and create access to good union jobs free from discrimination and harassment for all working people, with an emphasis on people of color, LGBTQ+, women, veterans, immigrants, individuals in rural communities, and individuals with disabilities. Finally, we ve been committed to strengthening ties and trust between Tribal Nations and the United States. From attending the Reservation Economic Summit and hosting our first Native Nations Industry Day at GSA Headquarters to holding nation-to-nation consultations and visiting with Tribal leaders and communities, we re building Nation-to- Nation partnerships so that our work in Indian Country strengthens businesses and communities. Looking to the future, GSA s updated action plan aims to further advance equity through the agency s high-impact program areas like Federal procurement, Federal buildings, and Federal technology design and delivery. It also gives increased emphasis to GSA s role in helping to strengthen the government s ability to be more agile, responsive, and reflective of Americans  needs through evaluation and data-driven insights. By focusing on these five strategies, GSA will use its unique position of delivering mission-critical services and core products across government to act as a force multiplier in advancing equity and reducing burdens for underserved communities. That is what good government is all about   and GSA is proud to do our part to strengthen our democracy and foster more trust between the Federal Government and the American people. Robin C. Carnahan Administrator, U.S. General Services Administration 3 U.S. General Services Administration Advancing Equity Through Agency Mission The mission of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is to deliver the best customer experience and value in real estate, acquisition, and technology services to the government and the American people. As we work to meet our goals of delivery on behalf of the government, we are only meeting our mission as a federal agency if the American people can equitably benefit from our efforts. That means that as GSA leverages its over $85 billion buying power to provide Federal purchasers with cost-effective, high-quality products and services from commercial vendors, we are also advancing the diversity of the American supplier base and economic security for small businesses. When we provide critical technology services and modernizations, GSA has a mission to ensure that digital government is reflective of and designed to perform for all the diverse communities we serve. As GSA plans and completes large scale construction projects across our 375 million rentable square feet of Federal real estate, we do so in a manner that is informed by local communities to ensure that the sustainability, vitality and livability made possible through Federal investment is available to every American neighborhood. GSA s mission is government delivery   and that includes delivering on the American promise of equal opportunity, civil rights, and justice for all. Executive Summary In response to Executive Order 14091 on Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, the U.S. General Services Administration has undertaken an agenda to operationalize equity across its public-facing mission critical programs and services. Not only do these updated strategies build on the successes and learnings from our 2022 Equity Action Plan, they further integrate cross-cutting equity goals in important and impactful ways. Deeper synergies are possible to realize across priorities related to economic justice, sustainable and equitable development, customer experience and digital government, gender equity, environmental justice, protecting civil rights, and support for an ecosystem of sociodemographic community groups, Tribes, and institutions. Another core tenet of this plan is GSA s commitment to expanding Federal interagency coordination and advancing meaningful engagement with the public when it matters most and can make a difference. This collaborative posture reflects GSA s unique role in government as an agency that supports other agencies in their mission success. GSA s business is the business of government - whether that is helping buyers and sellers connect more efficiently and equitably in Federal marketplaces, modernizing and delivering high-impact digital solutions, challenging industry to join us in tackling the climate crisis through sustainable supply chain innovations, or driving the revitalization of American neighborhoods by putting people to work in their communities with good jobs paid for by once-in-a-generation infrastructure investments. This plan outlines five strategies to advance and embed equity in Fiscal Year (FY) 2024:   Advance Equity, Economic Justice, and the Diversity of the American Supplier Base through Federal Procurement. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objective of economic justice; and it aims to address barriers faced by small and disadvantaged businesses as they participate in the Federal marketplace. Key actions are designed to improve contracting efficiency and success through data insights, innovative procurement tools, and greater collaboration across Federal agencies. 4 U.S. General Services Administration   Deliver Equitable, Accessible and Inclusive Digital Government to the American Public. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objectives of Economic Justice and Civil Rights; and it aims to address potential barriers and biases present in public interactions with civic tech. Key actions include advancing human centered design and community-informed user research practices, scaling language access, and ensuring responsible adoption and procurement of AI-enabled technologies.   Advance Equity, Economic Security, Sustainability and Environmental Justice through Large-Scale Construction Projects and the Federal Buildings Footprint. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objectives of Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, and Housing Justice and Community Investment; and it aims to address barriers to community benefits realized through equitable and sustainable Federal development. Key actions are designed to improve planning and access to local opportunities - like good jobs and cleaner, more climate change-resilient communities, made possible by landmark Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act investments.   Advance Equity and Effectiveness of Federal Programs Through Rigorous Review, Evaluation and Continuous Improvement. This strategy supports the whole- of-government equity objectives of Civil Rights, Health Equity, Economic Justice, Global Equality; and it aims to ensure Federal programs are working as intended, particularly programs that provide critical support to the public during emergencies and recovery after disasters. Key actions include scaling the Federal Government s use of evaluations to surface important findings and areas of improvement in the design and delivery of Federal programs.   Advance Equitable Access to Opportunity and Federal Resources for Local Communities and Minority Serving Institutions. This strategy supports the whole-of- government equity objectives of Civil Rights and Economic Justice; and it aims to reduce barriers to access for institutions that, through Federal resources, help close critical gaps in capacity and infrastructure for the local communities they serve. Key actions include conducting proactive civil rights compliance reviews of the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program and broadening partnerships - including contracting agreements - between Federal agencies and Minority Serving Institutions. Approaches to the five strategies are meant to be tactical and have measurable outcomes. At the heart of these strategies are the American people   particularly those who are overcoming systemic burdens, have been locked out of a fair chance at opportunities or are disproportionately in the path of harm when disaster strikes. GSA has developed our agency actions to reflect the needs of the people, identified through data and feedback collected in our own regular engagement and evaluation practices and with the help of thoughtfully researched insights generated from trusted industry experts and Federal partners. 5 U.S. General Services Administration Equity Progress Updates and Accomplishments 2022 Equity Action Plan Update In January 2022, GSA released its inaugural Equity Action Plan in accordance with Executive Order 13985: Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. To develop this plan, GSA conducted equity assessments and identified a set of actions for three high-impact program areas: Federal procurement, Federal buildings footprint, and Federal technology design and delivery. The section below provides an overview of the key accomplishments achieved since publication of the original Equity Action Plan. Advancing Equity and Supplier Diversity in Federal Procurement   In FY 2022, $2.8 billion of GSA contracting obligations went to small businesses, including 21.4% to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs); In FY 2023, GSA increased its small business contracting obligations to $3.3 billion, representing over 50% of the agency s eligible spending.   Launched a new Supplier Base Dashboard to provide more transparency and public reporting on Federal efforts to increase the number of new entrants to the Federal marketplace and reverse the general decline in the small business supplier base.   Signed a new 8(a) partnership agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration to increase 8(a) contracting opportunities and make it easier for Federal agencies to buy from 8(a) businesses for common goods and services needs.   Established new contracting pools in the growing Federal marketplace of Information Technology services and solutions to bolster participation of Women-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran- Owned Small Business, and small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones. The 8(a) STARS III contracts have been awarded to 1,111 SDB. 290  rising stars  have received their first awards exceeding $925 million in obligations.   Expanded tools to support Minority Serving Institutions with training and technical assistance to achieve success in the Federal contracting marketplace.   Established a Post-Award Engagement strategy to support disadvantaged and socioeconomic small businesses, which oftentimes still face challenges in successfully earning sales after being awarded a GSA contract.   Published the first-ever Supplier Diversity Plan to support Federal marketplace participation of SDB.   Updated the Multiple Award Schedule Welcome Package and Roadmap to improve information access and assist new contractors with success in marketing and managing their contracts. 6 Advancing Equity and Accessibility in Federal Technology U.S. General Services Administration   Launched an Equity Study on Remote Identity, recruiting 4,000 Americans, to understand potential barriers and demographic disparities in identity verification technologies that are commonly used by the public when accessing Federal services and benefits.   Developed and started implementing a roadmap for USAGov and USAGov en Espa ol to streamline content and make it easier for the public to find and access Federal benefits and services across a digital platform that connects people with government information more than 117 million times a year.   Vote.gov worked to expand access to voter registration information in communities that, due to language barriers, have not been historically part of the electorate. The platform added several Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) languages including: Bengali, Khmer, Korean, Hindi, Tagalog, and Vietnamese, with Chinese (both simplified and traditional) and its first Alaska Native language, Yup ik- Akuzipik.   Login.gov partnered with Federal agencies and State governments to provide secure, accessible identity verification services for benefits and emergency assistance programs. As an example, the U.S. Department of Labor pilot in Arkansas, helping more than 19,000 citizens of the State verify their identities while applying for unemployment benefits.   Advanced public participation and equitable user research practices through user compensation pilots and increased outreach efforts to community-based organizations.   Partnered with the U.S. Web Design System to launch new Inclusion Pattern Guidance, a library of design guidance and examples focused on reducing the public s barriers in key digital government interactions and fostering effective, inclusive, and equitable digital experiences. Advancing Equity and Sustainability in the Public Buildings Footprint   Leveraged the Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool and Federal Interagency Thriving Communities Network to develop engagement strategies that advance sustainable and equitable development goals and connect communities with resources in large-scale Federal investments made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.   Established partnerships with the U.S. Department of Labor on the Mega Construction Project Program and Good Jobs Initiative to advance equal opportunity in the construction trade workforce and expand the use of Project Labor Agreements on Federal projects over $35 million.   Launched the Access-for- All universal design challenge for U.S. architecture students and apprentices to source best national ideas on improving the accessibility and gender inclusiveness of Federal properties.   Partnered with the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and updated the Art in Architecture program rules to expand public access and artist representation in the millions of dollars of commissioned artworks permanently installed in Federal facilities. 7 U.S. General Services Administration   Issued recommendations from the Environmental Justice and Equity in Federal Sustainable Buildings Task Group and appointed two new environmental justice subject matter experts to the Green Building Advisory Committee, a Federal advisory committee that explores the climate modernization and sustainable development of Federal real estate in ways that are responsive to the needs of local communities.   Commissioned a survey and issued a first-ever GSA report on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) practices in design and construction industries.   Partnered with the National organization of Minority Architects to expand career opportunities for underserved communities in the architecture, engineering, design, and construction industries. Additional Efforts to Advance Equity Implementation of Landmark Legislation   The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) was designed to address immediate needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on addressing historically disparate outcomes across race, class, and geography that were further exacerbated by the pandemic. To support the Federal Government s exploration of questions about equitable recovery, GSA s Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) established an ARP Evaluation Portfolio with two core elements: a national evaluation conducted by a third-party research contract, and a portfolio of evaluations conducted by OES, in partnership with agencies and the White House Office of Management and Budget, on ARP-funded programs with equity goals. This body of work explores effectiveness of critical relief programs like Emergency Rental Assistance and Homeowner Assistance Fund.   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides $3.4 billion for GSA s Public Buildings Service, making a significant impact on 26 Land Ports of Entry modernizations along the Canadian and Mexican border. These projects will create new good-paying jobs, bolster safety and security, and make our economy more resilient to supply chain challenges   all while serving as models for sustainability and innovation and improving community livability.   The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides GSA with $2.15 billion for low-embodied carbon materials in construction and renovation projects, $975 million for GSA to support emerging and sustainable technologies, and $250 million to turn even more GSA facilities into High-Performance Green Buildings and accelerate efforts to achieve a net- zero Federal footprint. These investments will reduce long-term energy costs for American communities, strengthen America s domestic industrial base and catalyze innovation and job growth in homegrown industries that produce next-generation materials, products, and equipment. GSA estimates that these projects will create over 9,500 average annual economy-wide jobs across the length of the projects, support $2.8 billion in labor income, and generate nearly $1 billion in tax revenue for Federal, State and local governments. 8 Support for Tribes and Native Communities U.S. General Services Administration   GSA has prioritized engaging in Tribal Consultations in a proactive and meaningful manner throughout Fiscal Year 23. In addition to robust Tribal engagement as part of BIL project planning, GSA hosted the agency s first formal in-person Tribal Consultation event at the Reservation Economic Summit (RES) in April 2023. Over 100 participants joined Administrator Carnahan and GSA leaders for discussions on major topics of interest to Indian Country, including GSA s support of tribes, small business contracting, partnering with GSA to procure electric vehicles, and a pilot program to support Federal buying of carbon pollution-free electricity from Tribal organizations. Also, GSA issued a Guide to Using GSA Solutions and debuted a new search feature that enables buyers to search for Native American business categories in the GSA Advantage! , GSA eBuy and GSA eLibrary e-tools to find commercial products and services. This will foster greater Native American business participation in the Federal marketplace, help customers more easily meet Buy Indian Act needs, and strengthen the ability for tribes to pursue intertribal commerce efforts. Environmental Justice   GSA is committed to institutionalizing the principles of Justice40 - ensuring that the benefits of Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution, advancing equitable and sustainable development, and mitigating the disproportionate burdens faced by underserved communities in the climate crisis. Our Good Neighbor Program helps construction project teams, local governments and communities address common environmental justice challenges - like flooding from aging water systems, heat islands caused by lack of tree canopy, and air pollution from commercial traffic patterns - during the urban planning process. GSA s Environmental Justice Scorecard highlights include 27 Tribal Consultations related to environmental justice from January 2021 to September 2022 and improving environmental justice literacy through training provided to GSA s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Network. Strategies to Advance Equity in Fiscal Year 2024 Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Economic Justice Strategy #1: Advance Equity, Economic Justice, and the Diversity of the American Supplier Base through Federal Procurement Barriers to Equity Through existing public research and GSA s own regular industry engagement efforts, the agency has identified core challenges1 facing disadvantaged small business communities that impede their success and contribute to persistent systemic economic disparities. Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) and Socioeconomic Small Businesses (SESBs)2 are vulnerable to compounding obstacles in achieving competitive pricing, administrative burdens in 1 The Probability of Winning Federal Contracts: An Analysis Of Small Minority Owned Firms (June 2022), U.S. Department of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency. 2 Includes SBA certified socioeconomic set-aside categories: 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Tribes and Tribal- owned businesses, and small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones 9 U.S. General Services Administration navigating government s diffuse information and processes, and disproportionately negative outcomes relative to other businesses while competing for Federal contracts and obligations   including the approximately $85 billion in annual contracts facilitated by GSA. GSA s plan to advance equity in Federal procurement coordinates and builds on key actions that take a holistic approach to reducing barriers and improving outcomes at critical stages of the Federal contracting lifecycle, with the goal to increase overall marketplace participation rates and the amount of Federal contracting dollars awarded to underserved and disinvested communities. Key Actions Enable greater Federal contracting marketplace transparency and efficiency through data-driven tools and insights. Federal agencies and the Federal acquisition workforce play a critical role in creating, sustaining, and growing opportunities where small businesses can fairly compete and succeed in being awarded government contracts. GSA is committed to helping buyers and sellers more effectively execute on all eligible small business opportunities, which includes our role in providing contracting data insights to the Federal Government and the public in support of these goals:   Expand Federal agency use of the Forecast of Contracting Opportunities Tool. The tool assists with acquisition planning by helping vendors learn about potential prime contracting opportunities early in the process. Improved search functionality will simplify the process for the Federal user to post and maintain opportunities. Maximizing Federal agency use of the tool and creating a single forecast for the public to access will greatly ease the burden on small businesses attempting to track opportunities across multiple sources of information.   Launch and scale Federal agency adoption of new Government-wide Procurement Equity Tool. The tool uses Federal contracting data sources to support market research focused on small disadvantaged businesses. Federal agencies can use the tool to find SDBs by geographic location, business type and category. Agencies can also find new SDBs that have registered to do business but have yet to receive a federal award.   Enhance eBuy, the Request for Quote (RFQ) platform for GSA Schedule. eBuy is a powerful and intuitive acquisition tool used by thousands of Federal agencies and military services worldwide to help save government time and money as acquisitions achieve required competition, best pricing and value. Planned and ongoing updates to eBuy include new features that benefit both buyers and sellers by creating more visibility and simplification in quoting, Request for Information (RFI), and RFQ interactions. Facilitate greater supplier diversity and contracting success through GSA acquisition products and innovation. GSA acquisition vehicles are trusted and proven entry points for small businesses to begin and find early success in the Federal marketplace. The Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) and Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) are standout sources of eligible award dollars available to small disadvantaged businesses to compete for contracts in Federal common goods and services, and in high-growth categories like information technology and solutions. GSA supports overall governmentwide procurement equity efforts by ensuring the universe of our own contracting opportunities drive innovation and are responsive to the complex needs of our customers and vendors. These actions include:   Establish and implement a new 8(a) partnership agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration. This new 8(a) partnership agreement makes it easier for Federal agencies to use GSA s Government-wide contracts, including the Federal Supply Schedules, to identify and make awards to 8(a) firms. Creation of an 8(a) 10 U.S. General Services Administration Schedule pool will allow for sole source opportunities to SDBs, which significantly reduces burden on small businesses to obtain orders and gain Federal work experience. GSA will update the solicitation to begin adding new 8(a) contractors to the Schedule, will enhance eTools to identify eligible 8(a) contractors on eBuy and GSA Advantage! and will update and roll-out training for its acquisition workforce and Federal agencies on the new process.   Create new sustainability-focused markets in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Defense. Climate risk adaptation efforts and Federal sustainability goals are positioned to deploy hundreds of millions of dollars in new acquisition opportunities, including those available to small businesses, over the near/medium term. GSA is driving new and emerging market successes in Low Embodied Carbon building materials, Zero-Emission Vehicles and supply equipment, scaling of eco-labels to reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and expediting procurement availability of environmental technologies.   Finalize solicitations and awards for new Polaris and OASIS+ contracts.3 These newly launched governmentwide IT and professional services contracts offer more opportunities for small businesses to compete for prime contracts, including small business and socioeconomic set-asides. Since 2015, GSA s current OASIS vehicle has helped Federal agencies obligate more than $67 billion. Improve accessibility and reduce administrative burden. GSA committed to reviewing 37 Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) forms and identifying six design changes to appearance and layout (e.g., limiting use of capitalization and italics, continuity of 12-point font and bolded text for readability) that could make the standard forms easier to navigate for people with dyslexia, limited vision and intellectual disabilities. GSA will redesign FAR forms and launch a public awareness campaign about the updates. For FY 2024, GSA will also increase its pledge to the AbilityOne program, a critical source for buying goods and services from suppliers who support the employment of people with disabilities.     Further implement and enhance the Post-Award Engagement (PAE) Strategy. Fiscal Year 2023 sales data for SDBs and SESBs will serve as the Year 1 baseline to evaluate the efficacy of PAE plan activities. Based on analysis, GSA will update actions for post-award interventions that address the phenomena of persistent low or no sales, including: targeted training, matchmaking industry days and technical assistance. Measuring Our Progress: Federal Procurement Equity GSA will know if we are achieving measurable results for the small business communities we serve by tracking quarterly and annual progress against key metrics, including:     increased number and percentage of disadvantaged and socioeconomic small businesses active in core GSA marketplaces; increased total dollars and percentage obligated to SDBs and SESBs relative to GSA s overall eligible annual spending;   downward trends in number and percentage of SDBs and SESBs with no or low sales;   upward trends in SDBs and SESBs average dollar value of awards and percentage of market share;   upward trends in SDBs and SESBs overall new entrants and increased participation in high-growth and emerging market segments; improved overall qualitative data results from customer and vendor surveys, focus   3 GSA is responsive to any protest decisions and remains committed to providing opportunities for small businesses while supporting Federal agencies in their small business goals. 11 groups, and training feedback. U.S. General Services Administration Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Economic Justice Strategy #2: Deliver Equitable, Accessible and Inclusive Digital Government to the American Public Barriers to Equity Although technology continues to rapidly evolve, persistent inequities in technology design and delivery   like higher false rejection rates, completion failure rates, and time burdens - disproportionately negatively impact those from historically and socially marginalized communities. Additionally, digital services very often fail to prioritize human-centered design and usability beyond compliance. This means that Americans who likely have a critical need to connect with government information and services through digital platforms also are likely to have the hardest time doing so. Examples include both lack of access to the newest hardware or good internet, which often means newer digital platforms do not perform as well (because they are not built for older devices or don t work with low bandwidth connections), or software that is not designed to work across all populations, such as lack of plain language impacting populations with limited English proficiency or poorly trained AI models causing biometric systems to perform worse for people with different ages or skin tones. GSA   through its consulting and fellowships offerings such as the Centers of Excellence and the Presidential Innovation Fellows, shared services such as Login.gov and the US Web Design System, and Federal partners in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and United States Digital Service   plays a central role in the responsible development, deployment, and procurement of technologies used by the Federal Government to communicate or interact with the public.4 GSA is committed to delivering high-impact digital services and products in a manner that improves customer experience, reduces burden, broadens access, and advances civic tech practices that are intrinsically equity-aware and community-informed. Key Actions Mitigate bias and advance responsible adoption of civic technologies, including machine learning-enabled and emerging technologies. GSA s own internal product testing processes, as well as publicly available, peer-reviewed technical research studies from academic institutions and government research partners - like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - have identified user experience disparities and efficacy gaps in machine learning and AI-enabled technologies that adversely impact users, including: people with darker skin tones, people in rural areas with low bandwidth, people using older electronic devices, nonbinary and transgender people, people with disabilities, and people whose native language is not English.5 The negative impacts listed above compound for government websites and digital services, including services that have the potential to impact rights (like access to benefits or other government services). For example, a user with darker skin tone who is more likely to live in a neighborhood with low-bandwidth internet access and have an older device is thus more likely to experience increased friction in their attempt to use a government website or service. 4 AI Guide for Government, IT Modernization Centers of Excellence; Blueprint for AI Bill of Rights, OSTP 5 Face Recognition Technology Evaluation (FRTE) Part 1: Verification (2023), NIST 12 U.S. General Services Administration   Complete the Equity Study on Remote Identity-Proofing and publish findings. GSA launched the study and is recruiting 4,000 members of the public for participation. The peer-reviewed final report will present a statistical analysis of the performance of proofing checks, like facial verification, across a number of sociodemographic factors and explore the causes behind any negative or inconclusive results. GSA will use the results of this study, in combination with findings from other Federal agency efforts, to establish recommendations and inform future product iteration, including on Login.gov.   Advance equity through civic tech shared services and large-scale modernization investments. GSA provides expertise via a portfolio of mission critical digital government projects through its universe of technologists and product managers in TTS Consulting, Presidential Innovation Fellows, U.S. Digital Corps and the Benefits Studio. The agency also supports improvements to government delivery and IT infrastructure, including automation, through investments made by the Technology Modernization Fund. These platforms are positioned to apply equity frameworks in the way government programs and services are effectively designed and delivered to the American public. Expand digital accessibility, language access, public participation and equitable user research practices. Traditional outreach, user research, data collection (including Artificial Intelligence-trained datasets), content strategy and customer experience testing methods often do not sufficiently include underrepresented groups. This means that as technology is built and deployed, those end users of the public who likely most need to connect with government information and services will often have the most difficulty accessing them. GSA will continue actions that strengthen relationships with stakeholders and meaningfully integrate the needs of communities as part of our digital services.   Strengthen relationships with underserved user communities and build capacity for research operations. Governmentwide customer experience efforts focus on improving the digital interactions of communities and individuals with accessibility needs such as physical or mental disabilities and those experiencing major life events such as recovering from disasters, emergencies or financial shock, new and expecting parents, and those planning for retirement. GSA will continue integrating usability testing and research operations capabilities, including the expansion of user compensation pilots,6 to directly track how well our digital services are working and meeting the diverse needs of the public.   Modernize GSA s high-impact7 service providers to improve digital accessibility and language access. GSA s public-facing digital assets like USA.gov, Login.gov and Vote.gov connect tens of millions of Americans to Federal services and information. GSA will continue modernization efforts to make our digital services more accessible, understandable, and easy-to-use. This includes platforming new language translations and designing from native speaker experiences, like USAGov en Espa ol, as well as driving universal design standards in partnership with U.S. Web Design System.   Develop a plain-language accessibility checklist in collaboration with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). This will enable any team developing cloud-based services and digital solutions to incorporate accessibility into their process, regardless of their expertise. Operationalizing accessibility knowledge and evaluation for Federal employee use helps improve overall digital government 6 Handbook: Doing Research at GSA Technology Transformation Services 7 Federal agency High Impact Service Providers (HISP) are identified by the President s Management Agenda due to the scale and impact of their public-facing services. 13 accessibility and performance outcomes for older devices, such as, and especially for mobile, rural, and low-bandwidth users. U.S. General Services Administration Measuring Our Progress: Equitable and Accessible Digital Government GSA will know if we are achieving measurable positive change in Federal public-serving digital products and services by tracking progress against key metrics, including:             reduced negative impacts (e.g., false rejection rates in biometric identity-proofing, task completion rates, slow page load times for low- and limited-bandwidth connections) and closing those efficacy gaps across sociodemographic factors increased product efficacy and higher overall scores in usability tests increased digital accessibility fluency and compliance across GSA high-impact products increased number of community-based organizations with active user research pipelines for GSA product testing increased and proportionate participation of users from underserved community groups in GSA product testing at scale increased number of available and platform-integrated non-English languages in high- impact digital services and products Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, Housing Justice and Community Investment Strategy #3: Advance Equity, Economic Security and Environmental Justice through Large-Scale Construction Projects and the Federal Buildings Footprint Barriers to Equity The Federal real estate footprint - including the 375 million rentable square feet owned and operated by GSA - has significant generational impact on communities nationwide. Federal construction projects act as anchors for economic security, reliable opportunities for good local jobs, defenses against the negative impacts of climate change, and can advance the overall livability and vitality of American communities. GSA s work often occurs in or adjacent to disadvantaged communities that have suffered from long-standing underinvestment and have dealt with historic challenges and barriers to equitable development. These communities tend to have poor transportation connectivity to job opportunities, higher exposure to many forms of pollution, and less access to green space. The impacts of this inequity are apparent in the persistent lower household income, high unemployment, and poorer health outcomes.8 In order to help overcome these barriers, GSA is executing projects with enhanced stakeholder engagement and data analysis to better inform GSA decisionmakers and project teams about local development contexts and better connect project location, design, and facility operations with the needs of those communities that will benefit from more equitable development. Projects implemented under the nearly $7 billion made available to GSA through historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) investments are poised to bolster economies with small and local business participation, improve job and jobsite quality for workers and trade labor, address sustainability and environmental justice concerns, and strengthen relationships between levels of government, Tribes, and communities. 8 Assessing the Legacies of Historical Redlining, Urban Institute (2023) 14 U.S. General Services Administration Key Actions Aid the economic success of construction industries, contractors, and labor forces. Governmentwide implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is estimated to create 800,000 good-paying jobs9, but the possibility of critical shortages in construction and craft labor could threaten the timely and successful completion of these projects.10 GSA is committed to scaling the impact of our BIL and other building modernization investments through collaboration with other Federal agencies and our industry partners.   Implement the Good Jobs Initiative partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor to create and support clear pathways for workers to high-quality, good-paying jobs in construction, maintenance, manufacturing, and operations. The actions outlined in the signed Memorandum of Understanding11 aim to support equitable and effective workforce development, including those from nontraditional and underserved labor sources; and improve job quality, standards and metrics on GSA construction sites.   Build and release new Geographic Information System (GIS) data-informed public forecasting resources for BIL and IRA related construction projects. GIS is a computer system that analyzes and displays geographically referenced information. It uses data that is attached to a unique location. By providing more visibility and transparency about where and when Federal projects are happening, GSA can help Federal contractors, trade labor, and community stakeholders effectively plan and better connect with opportunities. This effort will help more Americans, including those from underserved communities, with access to quality employment in their communities. Increase contracting opportunities for socioeconomically disadvantaged small businesses across growing markets in construction, clean energy, and sustainability. GSA will take actions aimed to maximize participation of SDB and build its small business contractor base by improving the forecasting process, strengthening relationships with existing contractors, executing its plans for industry engagement and utilizing the Governmentwide Procurement Equity Tool to identify eligible and new businesses ready to bid for work where GSA projects are located.   Achieve equitable and sustainable development impacts through data-driven insights, Federal partnerships and community engagement. New Federal integrated data mapping and urban planning resources, like the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool have provided GSA with deeper insights about community needs and challenges during the project planning process. This includes opportunities for GSA to collaborate directly with State/local governments and communities on ways to address environmental justice concerns, meet development goals, and scale impact through better and more robust coordination between Federal agencies.   Identify and announce a near-term portfolio of projects for targeted environmental justice and sustainability actions. GSA s Center for Urban Development/Good Neighbor Program will develop a priority list of site repair work at Federal buildings that would correct deficiencies in ways that also bring positive local sustainability impacts, address environmental justice concerns, and fulfill community planning goals. Relevant issues would include stormwater runoff, extreme heat, and tree canopy, as well as accessibility and improving aesthetics. These projects will provide meaningful benefit to the communities surrounding Federal properties and help to maximize the positive 9 Macroeconomic Consequences of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Moody s Analytics (November 2021) 10 Will a labor crunch derail plans to upgrade U.S. infrastructure?, McKinsey & Company (October 2022) 11 General Services Administration - Department of Labor Good Jobs Memorandum of Understanding (2023) 15 U.S. General Services Administration impact of GSA repair investments.   Continue Leveraging the Federal Thriving Communities Network12 to connect GSA stakeholder communities with additional climate and infrastructure resources. While GSA does not issue grants, it can proactively ensure that the communities we serve are better able to connect with place-based technical assistance and other IRA and BIL resources made available through Federal agency partners like U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Department of Commerce.   Complete a study on the impacts of Federal real property disposal. After it is determined that excess real property is no longer needed by the Federal Government, various statutes authorize conveyance13 to State and local governments and in some cases, to nonprofits at up to 100% discount for public benefit use. Some of the qualifying uses include public health, homeless assistance, education, park and recreation, correctional, law enforcement, and emergency management. This study will give GSA important new insights on how portfolio disposal decisions affect surrounding communities in the near and long-term. Measuring Our Progress: Equitable and Sustainable Public Buildings Footprint GSA will know if we are achieving measurable positive impacts in the communities where Federal construction projects and buildings are located by tracking progress against key metrics, including:     increased diversity in the supplier base, including broadened participation from Tribal and disadvantaged businesses contracted to Federal construction projects and increased total dollars awarded to these businesses as a percentage of project value increased number of small and socioeconomic businesses, including new entrants, awarded contracts in the region where Federal projects are located increased number of Project Labor Agreements executed     overall improved job and jobsite quality scores across GSA portfolio projects   increased and more accessible pathways to training and employment opportunities in regions where GSA projects are located increased initiation and execution of community development goals established during Planning Outreach and Partnership engagements     number of GSA community stakeholders who are awarded place-based assistance grants through Thriving Communities opportunities; indicators of reduced burden in disadvantaged Census tracts with GSA environmental justice ameliorations Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Health Equity, Economic Justice, Global Equality Strategy #4: Advance Equity and Effectiveness of Federal Programs Through Rigorous Review, Evaluation and Continuous Improvement Barriers to Equity The Federal Government s exploration of the equitable and effective deployment of benefits, resources and critical relief programs in the near and long term, particularly after national emergencies, is an essential part of how the government performs continuous improvement of 12 https://www.transportation.gov/Federal-interagency-thriving-communities-network 13 https://disposal.gsa.gov/s/PBC 16 U.S. General Services Administration its functions and works better for all Americans. As an example, Federal resources deployed to address immediate needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic faced challenges in equitably reaching communities who were already suffering from legacy disparities in and outcomes across race, class, and geography; these systemic inequities were further exacerbated by the pandemic.14 By conducting more frequent and rigorous evaluation of both the methods used to deliver government resources and the impacts of Federal programs on the public, the Federal Government has the potential to more fully understand if programs are working as intended, better interrupt bias further upstream and modernize systems for greater efficacy   with the ultimate goal of meeting the needs of communities, particularly the most vulnerable, when it matters the most. Undertaking evaluation can be expensive, time consuming, and may require Federal agencies to build capacity for data or research needs before being able to initiate this important work. Additionally, once evaluations are completed, Federal agencies face challenges with resources or infrastructure to act on key findings; and results from evaluations currently lack communication strategies that can more easily raise awareness for the public and catalyze implementation, including across non-Federal stakeholders who also benefit from these insights. Key Actions Complete, publish and share learnings from governmentwide equity evaluations. GSA serves a unique function in the government by providing other Federal agencies with help building and using evidence. We partner with Federal agencies to answer priority questions with rigorous evaluation methods and administrative data. We design and conduct evaluations of existing programs - including life-saving programs like disaster relief, emergency assistance, and crisis hotlines - and recommend evidence-based program changes, with the ultimate goal of improving how the government is serving all Americans.   Increase the number of Federal agencies and programs initiating equity evaluations. GSA currently partners with a handful of Federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Treasury and the U.S. Department of Education. GSA will increase its capacity for new evaluation agreements and work to recruit additional Federal agencies and programs to the service. Additionally, GSA will partner with the White House and interagency councils to bolster Federal agency capacity and readiness to undertake evaluations.   Conduct public engagement and increase awareness of equity evaluation findings. The conclusions and recommendations generated from these evaluation efforts are not only useful to the Federal Government. They provide important insights to State and local governments who coordinate downstream Federal resources to communities and act as a public accountability tool to the communities themselves. GSA will undertake a strategic communications campaign to raise awareness of key findings and ensure the research has maximum impact through its scaled application by end users. Measuring Our Progress: Equitable Administration of Government Programs GSA will know if we are effectively supporting positive change in Federal programs and the equitable delivery of government by several key factors, including:   number of Federal agencies and programs undertaking equity evaluations 14 How COVID-19 Has Magnified Pre-existing Inequalities in the US, Boston University (2022) 17   Number of Federal agencies and programs implementing updates based on findings increased number of people and communities reached by engagement and public   outreach actions about evaluation findings indicators of reduced burden and improved access where Federal program delivery has been revised based on evaluation findings   U.S. General Services Administration Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Economic Justice Strategy #5: Advance Equitable Access to Opportunity and Federal Resources for Local Communities and Minority Serving Institutions Barriers to Equity Rural, socioeconomically underserved, and historically disinvested communities, including Tribes and institutions that serve disadvantaged and minority populations like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), disproportionately rely on Federal goods and services to bridge critical resource gaps.15 Yet barriers to information, administrative burdens in navigating government processes, capacity and infrastructure gaps to meet government requirements, and equitable access to resource pathways prevent communities from fully realizing the available benefits from Federal support and partnership. Key Actions Deliver more Federal goods and products to American communities in critical need through the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program.16 Administered by GSA, the program enables certain non-Federal organizations to obtain personal property that the Federal Government no longer needs. This property includes computers, office equipment and furniture, motor vehicles, aircraft, vessels, scientific devices and heavy machinery. GSA facilitates the distribution of millions of dollars in surplus Federal goods annually and the program is administered in each of the 56 States and territories by a State Agency for Surplus Property (SASP). In addition, State agencies, cities, local governments, Tribal governments, and non-profit organizations for the purposes of public health or education or services to veterans may obtain Federal surplus personal property through the donation program. Examples of recipients of property donations include, but are not limited to: public works departments, public health departments, childcare centers, homeless shelters, school districts, food banks, and HBCUs or other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs).   Establish a plan to conduct proactive reviews for the 56 State Agencies for Surplus Property to ensure their compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with a goal of 14 SASPs for review each fiscal year. GSA s Office of Civil Rights is responsible for GSA s administration of Title VI and will work to increase equitable access to programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance from GSA. Initiate an engagement and outreach plan to raise awareness in local communities about resources available through their State Agency for Surplus Property. GSA   15 Public and Private Investments and Divestments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, American Council on Education (ACE), UNCF (2019) 16 GSA guide: Federal Personal Property for Reuse and Sale 18 will integrate technical assistance and public education about the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program alongside other regular community engagement efforts that the agency coordinates. U.S. General Services Administration Advance procurement opportunities and partnerships between Federal Agencies and Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions. HBCUs and MSIs provide vital support to communities through higher education, cutting edge research, public health ecosystems, pathways to quality employment, and well-being for economically and socially underserved Americans. The Federal Government can better benefit from the deep and rich expertise of these institutions and can improve pathways to more robust and meaningful partnership with them, including through Federal contracting.   Increase the number of eligible HBCUs and MSIs on the GSA Multiple Award Schedule. The MAS is a long-term contract with commercial entities that provides Federal agencies with billions of dollars in annual access to common products and services needed by the government. GSA plans to conduct outreach to eligible institutions currently without MAS contracts, conduct training and provide technical assistance on how to get on the MAS, and host HBCU-focused industry days, matchmaking events and other strategic engagements to raise awareness and help better position HBCUs and MSIs to successfully do business with the Federal Government   Launch and scale adoption of new GSA public digital resource for MSIs. GSA s new public website to support Minority Serving Institutions will aggregate information and resources that help both Federal agencies and MSIs develop and sustain partnerships or contracting agreements. Resources include market research, capabilities assessments, support for exploring joint venture and other contractor team agreements and data tools to help advance supplier diversity across Federal Government procurement Measuring Our Progress: Equitable Access to Federal Resources GSA will know if we are effectively supporting positive change in Federal programs and the equitable delivery of government by several key factors, including:   number of completed civil rights SASP compliance reviews   increased number of people, communities, and MSIs reached by engagement and public outreach actions increased number of underserved communities, organizations, or geographic areas that that seek to participate in the Federal surplus goods program indicators of reduced burden and improved access where program compliance reviews and any required updates have been implemented Increased number of MSI and HBCUs participating in Federal contracts Increased number of overall Federal contracting dollars obligated to MSIs and HBCUs         19",

      "phase1_response": "## Policy Analysis Summary\n\n### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text\nThe GSA Equity Action Plan Updates for 2023 outlines the agency's commitment to integrating equity into all government operations. The plan emphasizes delivering efficient, effective, and equitable government services through a people-centered approach. It highlights GSA's role in investing in American jobs, digital government services, sustainability initiatives, and community strengthening, with over $6 billion in related investments mentioned. The policy frames equity as essential for better outcomes for all Americans.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text\nProclamation 10885 is a ceremonial executive order issued on January 20, 2025, directing that the American flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day and all future Inauguration Days at federal buildings, military installations, embassies, and other government facilities. The order also specifies that after Inauguration Day concludes, flags should return to half-staff in honor of former President Jimmy Carter until 30 days after his death have passed.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability\nThis executive order does **not apply** to the GSA Equity Action Plan policy. The executive order is purely ceremonial and administrative in nature, dealing exclusively with flag protocols for a specific day and commemorative period. It contains no provisions that would:\n\n- Modify, supersede, or conflict with equity initiatives\n- Change GSA's operational mandates or strategic priorities\n- Alter funding allocations or program implementations\n- Impact the delivery of government services or equity-focused policies\n\nThe executive order addresses flag display procedures, while the GSA policy addresses substantive programmatic and operational equity commitments. These operate in entirely separate policy domains with no jurisdictional overlap.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\nNo compliance actions are required, as the executive order does not affect the GSA Equity Action Plan. GSA facilities management should ensure compliance with the flag display requirements separately from any equity policy implementations.\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

GSA has explicit responsibility for managing federal buildings and grounds. The executive order mandates flag display requirements \"at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds\" - facilities that fall directly under GSA's operational jurisdiction.

      "phase2_response": "**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**\nThe GSA Equity Action Plan operates in the domain of **federal agency administration and civil rights/equity initiatives**. It focuses on ensuring equitable, accessible, and inclusive government services delivery, implementing diversity and inclusion practices within federal operations, and taking a people-centered approach to government service provision.\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**\nThe Executive Order \"Flying The Flag Of The United States At Full-Staff On Inauguration Day\" operates in the domain of **ceremonial protocols and federal building/facility management**. It establishes a specific flag display requirement for all federal buildings, grounds, military installations, and naval vessels on Inauguration Day.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nWhile both documents relate to federal government operations, they address fundamentally different aspects:\n- The policy focuses on programmatic equity initiatives and service delivery approaches\n- The executive order addresses ceremonial flag display protocols\n\nThe executive order creates a new operational requirement that GSA, as the federal government's property management agency, would need to implement across federal facilities under its jurisdiction.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment Context**\nThe phase1_flag of \"Not Affected\" appears to have missed the operational connection between GSA's facility management responsibilities and the new flag display requirements.\n\n**Final Decision: [Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: The GSA Equity Action Plan addresses federal agency administration, focusing on equitable service delivery, inclusive government operations, and people-centered approaches to federal services.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: The executive order establishes ceremonial protocols requiring full-staff flag display on federal properties during Inauguration Day.\n\n3. **Direct Impact Analysis**: There is a **direct operational impact**. GSA has explicit responsibility for managing federal buildings and grounds. The executive order mandates flag display requirements \"at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds\" - facilities that fall directly under GSA's operational jurisdiction.

Carnahan The General Services Administration s overarching goal is delivering efficient, effective government for the American people. As we look to the future, we re codifying another element into that goal: equity. The sacred trust between government and its citizens should inform every action, every decision, and every policy. It s our responsibility to get people the services they need, when they need them   that s why we re taking a people-centered approach to government. We know that government only works when it works for everyone, so I m proud to renew GSA s commitment to delivering a government that s equitable, accessible, and inclusive of the diverse nation we serve. GSA has a big role to play in fulfilling the mission of government, whether we re investing in American jobs, partnering with American industry and trade labor, delivering digital government with good customer experience, building a more sustainable future, or bolstering the strength of communities across the country. In all this, we re committed to making meaningful equity impacts, recognizing that equitable approaches lead to better outcomes for everyone. That s why our Equity Action Plan is so important. The heart of this plan is community and it provides us with ways we can both transform government in the long-term and ensure that what the government delivers has meaningful impacts on the daily lives of people all across the country. The good news is that we have the money and the momentum to make these kinds of impacts real. From Day One, the President has been focused on Investing in America   in our people, in our infrastructure, and in rebuilding our economy through historic, once-in-a-generation investments. I ve been out on the road a lot this year and I ve seen these strategies in action firsthand. To start, with over $6 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, we re making smart investments in GSA-controlled Federal buildings all across the country. We re focused on building spaces that are part of the communities they inhabit, modernizing them so they can easily provide services to the American people, and ensuring their resilience and sustainability. With every investment, we re seeking to address climate change because it s a triple win: creating good jobs, saving taxpayer dollars, and making a healthier future for generations to come. We know that historically underserved communities are too-often disproportionately impacted by climate change, so we re making sure that this triple win benefits everyone. 1 U.S. General Services Administration From Arizona to Ohio, I ve heard from workers that are proud to be part of this national transformation and that they see the benefits to their families, their communities, and American businesses. I ve met with trade labor unions, workers, and leaders in the building and construction industry, all of whom have shared with me how they re committed to these same goals. They re recruiting more women and people of color and training them in the tools and technologies we need to implement billions of dollars in investments. They know what we know: these investments will create pathways to the middle-class, strengthen communities across the country, and build a stronger and more prosperous future for everyone. At our federal buildings, we ve been partnering with local small businesses to guide them through the process of accessing opportunities across the Federal marketplace. We ve also been partnering with opportunity centers to raise awareness of these projects among the local communities. There s one location in D.C. where we ve helped over 35 businesses get onto government schedules and helped secure jobs for over 2,500 people. We re also focused on the physical accessibility of our buildings through our National Accessibility Program, the many efforts of our Office of Design and Construction, and our long-standing relationship with the U.S. Access Board. We also partnered with Challenge.gov to launch the  Access for All  universal and accessible design competition for U.S. architecture students to source best practice improvements. As the caretaker of the nation s largest public art collection, we ve preserved and expanded the people s collection over the last 50 years, placing art in Federal buildings and public spaces that tells the story of our nation and our democracy. We re committed to expanding opportunities for new artists to contribute, creating jobs while ensuring that the diversity and vibrancy of our portfolio reflects the diversity and vibrancy of the American story. Our Federal Acquisition Service and Office of Small & Disadvantaged Business Utilization are committed to making it easier for businesses to succeed in the Federal marketplace. From forecasting tools and new identifiers for a diverse range of businesses to training and outreach programs, we re actively expanding our supplier diversity, reducing barriers, and improving outcomes. In fact, GSA awarded more than $3.3 billion to small businesses, which represents over 50% of the agency's FY23 eligible spending, according to data current as of November 2, 2023. GSA s work delivering  services that are simple to use, accessible, equitable, protective, transparent, and responsive for all people  is evident in our digital capabilities as well. Our public-facing websites are 508 compliant, support assistive technology, and are available in multiple languages. In fact, Vote.gov has recently added its first Alaska Native language and multiple Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander languages to increase accessibility while supporting cultural vitality. We re also 2 U.S. General Services Administration engaging in equity studies across our Technology Transformation Services to ensure that we re providing human-centered tools that meet the needs of every American. We ve been partnering across the government as well. Our Office of Government-wide Policy IT Accessibility team helps agencies meet Federal compliance standards while our U.S. Web Design Services offers toolkits and best practices to ensure that Federal websites are accessible for everyone   that includes providing specific resources to support customers in varying socio-economic communities. Through our work with the Department of Labor s Good Jobs Initiative, we re helping improve job quality and create access to good union jobs free from discrimination and harassment for all working people, with an emphasis on people of color, LGBTQ+, women, veterans, immigrants, individuals in rural communities, and individuals with disabilities. Finally, we ve been committed to strengthening ties and trust between Tribal Nations and the United States. From attending the Reservation Economic Summit and hosting our first Native Nations Industry Day at GSA Headquarters to holding nation-to-nation consultations and visiting with Tribal leaders and communities, we re building Nation-to- Nation partnerships so that our work in Indian Country strengthens businesses and communities. Looking to the future, GSA s updated action plan aims to further advance equity through the agency s high-impact program areas like Federal procurement, Federal buildings, and Federal technology design and delivery. It also gives increased emphasis to GSA s role in helping to strengthen the government s ability to be more agile, responsive, and reflective of Americans  needs through evaluation and data-driven insights. By focusing on these five strategies, GSA will use its unique position of delivering mission-critical services and core products across government to act as a force multiplier in advancing equity and reducing burdens for underserved communities. That is what good government is all about   and GSA is proud to do our part to strengthen our democracy and foster more trust between the Federal Government and the American people. Robin C. Carnahan Administrator, U.S. General Services Administration 3 U.S. General Services Administration Advancing Equity Through Agency Mission The mission of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is to deliver the best customer experience and value in real estate, acquisition, and technology services to the government and the American people. As we work to meet our goals of delivery on behalf of the government, we are only meeting our mission as a federal agency if the American people can equitably benefit from our efforts. That means that as GSA leverages its over $85 billion buying power to provide Federal purchasers with cost-effective, high-quality products and services from commercial vendors, we are also advancing the diversity of the American supplier base and economic security for small businesses. When we provide critical technology services and modernizations, GSA has a mission to ensure that digital government is reflective of and designed to perform for all the diverse communities we serve. As GSA plans and completes large scale construction projects across our 375 million rentable square feet of Federal real estate, we do so in a manner that is informed by local communities to ensure that the sustainability, vitality and livability made possible through Federal investment is available to every American neighborhood. GSA s mission is government delivery   and that includes delivering on the American promise of equal opportunity, civil rights, and justice for all. Executive Summary In response to Executive Order 14091 on Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, the U.S. General Services Administration has undertaken an agenda to operationalize equity across its public-facing mission critical programs and services. Not only do these updated strategies build on the successes and learnings from our 2022 Equity Action Plan, they further integrate cross-cutting equity goals in important and impactful ways. Deeper synergies are possible to realize across priorities related to economic justice, sustainable and equitable development, customer experience and digital government, gender equity, environmental justice, protecting civil rights, and support for an ecosystem of sociodemographic community groups, Tribes, and institutions. Another core tenet of this plan is GSA s commitment to expanding Federal interagency coordination and advancing meaningful engagement with the public when it matters most and can make a difference. This collaborative posture reflects GSA s unique role in government as an agency that supports other agencies in their mission success. GSA s business is the business of government - whether that is helping buyers and sellers connect more efficiently and equitably in Federal marketplaces, modernizing and delivering high-impact digital solutions, challenging industry to join us in tackling the climate crisis through sustainable supply chain innovations, or driving the revitalization of American neighborhoods by putting people to work in their communities with good jobs paid for by once-in-a-generation infrastructure investments. This plan outlines five strategies to advance and embed equity in Fiscal Year (FY) 2024:   Advance Equity, Economic Justice, and the Diversity of the American Supplier Base through Federal Procurement. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objective of economic justice; and it aims to address barriers faced by small and disadvantaged businesses as they participate in the Federal marketplace. Key actions are designed to improve contracting efficiency and success through data insights, innovative procurement tools, and greater collaboration across Federal agencies. 4 U.S. General Services Administration   Deliver Equitable, Accessible and Inclusive Digital Government to the American Public. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objectives of Economic Justice and Civil Rights; and it aims to address potential barriers and biases present in public interactions with civic tech. Key actions include advancing human centered design and community-informed user research practices, scaling language access, and ensuring responsible adoption and procurement of AI-enabled technologies.   Advance Equity, Economic Security, Sustainability and Environmental Justice through Large-Scale Construction Projects and the Federal Buildings Footprint. This strategy supports the whole-of-government equity objectives of Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, and Housing Justice and Community Investment; and it aims to address barriers to community benefits realized through equitable and sustainable Federal development. Key actions are designed to improve planning and access to local opportunities - like good jobs and cleaner, more climate change-resilient communities, made possible by landmark Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act investments.   Advance Equity and Effectiveness of Federal Programs Through Rigorous Review, Evaluation and Continuous Improvement. This strategy supports the whole- of-government equity objectives of Civil Rights, Health Equity, Economic Justice, Global Equality; and it aims to ensure Federal programs are working as intended, particularly programs that provide critical support to the public during emergencies and recovery after disasters. Key actions include scaling the Federal Government s use of evaluations to surface important findings and areas of improvement in the design and delivery of Federal programs.   Advance Equitable Access to Opportunity and Federal Resources for Local Communities and Minority Serving Institutions. This strategy supports the whole-of- government equity objectives of Civil Rights and Economic Justice; and it aims to reduce barriers to access for institutions that, through Federal resources, help close critical gaps in capacity and infrastructure for the local communities they serve. Key actions include conducting proactive civil rights compliance reviews of the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program and broadening partnerships - including contracting agreements - between Federal agencies and Minority Serving Institutions. Approaches to the five strategies are meant to be tactical and have measurable outcomes. At the heart of these strategies are the American people   particularly those who are overcoming systemic burdens, have been locked out of a fair chance at opportunities or are disproportionately in the path of harm when disaster strikes. GSA has developed our agency actions to reflect the needs of the people, identified through data and feedback collected in our own regular engagement and evaluation practices and with the help of thoughtfully researched insights generated from trusted industry experts and Federal partners. 5 U.S. General Services Administration Equity Progress Updates and Accomplishments 2022 Equity Action Plan Update In January 2022, GSA released its inaugural Equity Action Plan in accordance with Executive Order 13985: Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. To develop this plan, GSA conducted equity assessments and identified a set of actions for three high-impact program areas: Federal procurement, Federal buildings footprint, and Federal technology design and delivery. The section below provides an overview of the key accomplishments achieved since publication of the original Equity Action Plan. Advancing Equity and Supplier Diversity in Federal Procurement   In FY 2022, $2.8 billion of GSA contracting obligations went to small businesses, including 21.4% to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs); In FY 2023, GSA increased its small business contracting obligations to $3.3 billion, representing over 50% of the agency s eligible spending.   Launched a new Supplier Base Dashboard to provide more transparency and public reporting on Federal efforts to increase the number of new entrants to the Federal marketplace and reverse the general decline in the small business supplier base.   Signed a new 8(a) partnership agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration to increase 8(a) contracting opportunities and make it easier for Federal agencies to buy from 8(a) businesses for common goods and services needs.   Established new contracting pools in the growing Federal marketplace of Information Technology services and solutions to bolster participation of Women-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran- Owned Small Business, and small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones. The 8(a) STARS III contracts have been awarded to 1,111 SDB. 290  rising stars  have received their first awards exceeding $925 million in obligations.   Expanded tools to support Minority Serving Institutions with training and technical assistance to achieve success in the Federal contracting marketplace.   Established a Post-Award Engagement strategy to support disadvantaged and socioeconomic small businesses, which oftentimes still face challenges in successfully earning sales after being awarded a GSA contract.   Published the first-ever Supplier Diversity Plan to support Federal marketplace participation of SDB.   Updated the Multiple Award Schedule Welcome Package and Roadmap to improve information access and assist new contractors with success in marketing and managing their contracts. 6 Advancing Equity and Accessibility in Federal Technology U.S. General Services Administration   Launched an Equity Study on Remote Identity, recruiting 4,000 Americans, to understand potential barriers and demographic disparities in identity verification technologies that are commonly used by the public when accessing Federal services and benefits.   Developed and started implementing a roadmap for USAGov and USAGov en Espa ol to streamline content and make it easier for the public to find and access Federal benefits and services across a digital platform that connects people with government information more than 117 million times a year.   Vote.gov worked to expand access to voter registration information in communities that, due to language barriers, have not been historically part of the electorate. The platform added several Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) languages including: Bengali, Khmer, Korean, Hindi, Tagalog, and Vietnamese, with Chinese (both simplified and traditional) and its first Alaska Native language, Yup ik- Akuzipik.   Login.gov partnered with Federal agencies and State governments to provide secure, accessible identity verification services for benefits and emergency assistance programs. As an example, the U.S. Department of Labor pilot in Arkansas, helping more than 19,000 citizens of the State verify their identities while applying for unemployment benefits.   Advanced public participation and equitable user research practices through user compensation pilots and increased outreach efforts to community-based organizations.   Partnered with the U.S. Web Design System to launch new Inclusion Pattern Guidance, a library of design guidance and examples focused on reducing the public s barriers in key digital government interactions and fostering effective, inclusive, and equitable digital experiences. Advancing Equity and Sustainability in the Public Buildings Footprint   Leveraged the Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool and Federal Interagency Thriving Communities Network to develop engagement strategies that advance sustainable and equitable development goals and connect communities with resources in large-scale Federal investments made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.   Established partnerships with the U.S. Department of Labor on the Mega Construction Project Program and Good Jobs Initiative to advance equal opportunity in the construction trade workforce and expand the use of Project Labor Agreements on Federal projects over $35 million.   Launched the Access-for- All universal design challenge for U.S. architecture students and apprentices to source best national ideas on improving the accessibility and gender inclusiveness of Federal properties.   Partnered with the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and updated the Art in Architecture program rules to expand public access and artist representation in the millions of dollars of commissioned artworks permanently installed in Federal facilities. 7 U.S. General Services Administration   Issued recommendations from the Environmental Justice and Equity in Federal Sustainable Buildings Task Group and appointed two new environmental justice subject matter experts to the Green Building Advisory Committee, a Federal advisory committee that explores the climate modernization and sustainable development of Federal real estate in ways that are responsive to the needs of local communities.   Commissioned a survey and issued a first-ever GSA report on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) practices in design and construction industries.   Partnered with the National organization of Minority Architects to expand career opportunities for underserved communities in the architecture, engineering, design, and construction industries. Additional Efforts to Advance Equity Implementation of Landmark Legislation   The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) was designed to address immediate needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on addressing historically disparate outcomes across race, class, and geography that were further exacerbated by the pandemic. To support the Federal Government s exploration of questions about equitable recovery, GSA s Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) established an ARP Evaluation Portfolio with two core elements: a national evaluation conducted by a third-party research contract, and a portfolio of evaluations conducted by OES, in partnership with agencies and the White House Office of Management and Budget, on ARP-funded programs with equity goals. This body of work explores effectiveness of critical relief programs like Emergency Rental Assistance and Homeowner Assistance Fund.   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides $3.4 billion for GSA s Public Buildings Service, making a significant impact on 26 Land Ports of Entry modernizations along the Canadian and Mexican border. These projects will create new good-paying jobs, bolster safety and security, and make our economy more resilient to supply chain challenges   all while serving as models for sustainability and innovation and improving community livability.   The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides GSA with $2.15 billion for low-embodied carbon materials in construction and renovation projects, $975 million for GSA to support emerging and sustainable technologies, and $250 million to turn even more GSA facilities into High-Performance Green Buildings and accelerate efforts to achieve a net- zero Federal footprint. These investments will reduce long-term energy costs for American communities, strengthen America s domestic industrial base and catalyze innovation and job growth in homegrown industries that produce next-generation materials, products, and equipment. GSA estimates that these projects will create over 9,500 average annual economy-wide jobs across the length of the projects, support $2.8 billion in labor income, and generate nearly $1 billion in tax revenue for Federal, State and local governments. 8 Support for Tribes and Native Communities U.S. General Services Administration   GSA has prioritized engaging in Tribal Consultations in a proactive and meaningful manner throughout Fiscal Year 23. In addition to robust Tribal engagement as part of BIL project planning, GSA hosted the agency s first formal in-person Tribal Consultation event at the Reservation Economic Summit (RES) in April 2023. Over 100 participants joined Administrator Carnahan and GSA leaders for discussions on major topics of interest to Indian Country, including GSA s support of tribes, small business contracting, partnering with GSA to procure electric vehicles, and a pilot program to support Federal buying of carbon pollution-free electricity from Tribal organizations. Also, GSA issued a Guide to Using GSA Solutions and debuted a new search feature that enables buyers to search for Native American business categories in the GSA Advantage! , GSA eBuy and GSA eLibrary e-tools to find commercial products and services. This will foster greater Native American business participation in the Federal marketplace, help customers more easily meet Buy Indian Act needs, and strengthen the ability for tribes to pursue intertribal commerce efforts. Environmental Justice   GSA is committed to institutionalizing the principles of Justice40 - ensuring that the benefits of Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution, advancing equitable and sustainable development, and mitigating the disproportionate burdens faced by underserved communities in the climate crisis. Our Good Neighbor Program helps construction project teams, local governments and communities address common environmental justice challenges - like flooding from aging water systems, heat islands caused by lack of tree canopy, and air pollution from commercial traffic patterns - during the urban planning process. GSA s Environmental Justice Scorecard highlights include 27 Tribal Consultations related to environmental justice from January 2021 to September 2022 and improving environmental justice literacy through training provided to GSA s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Network. Strategies to Advance Equity in Fiscal Year 2024 Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Economic Justice Strategy #1: Advance Equity, Economic Justice, and the Diversity of the American Supplier Base through Federal Procurement Barriers to Equity Through existing public research and GSA s own regular industry engagement efforts, the agency has identified core challenges1 facing disadvantaged small business communities that impede their success and contribute to persistent systemic economic disparities. Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) and Socioeconomic Small Businesses (SESBs)2 are vulnerable to compounding obstacles in achieving competitive pricing, administrative burdens in 1 The Probability of Winning Federal Contracts: An Analysis Of Small Minority Owned Firms (June 2022), U.S. Department of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency. 2 Includes SBA certified socioeconomic set-aside categories: 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Tribes and Tribal- owned businesses, and small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones 9 U.S. General Services Administration navigating government s diffuse information and processes, and disproportionately negative outcomes relative to other businesses while competing for Federal contracts and obligations   including the approximately $85 billion in annual contracts facilitated by GSA. GSA s plan to advance equity in Federal procurement coordinates and builds on key actions that take a holistic approach to reducing barriers and improving outcomes at critical stages of the Federal contracting lifecycle, with the goal to increase overall marketplace participation rates and the amount of Federal contracting dollars awarded to underserved and disinvested communities. Key Actions Enable greater Federal contracting marketplace transparency and efficiency through data-driven tools and insights. Federal agencies and the Federal acquisition workforce play a critical role in creating, sustaining, and growing opportunities where small businesses can fairly compete and succeed in being awarded government contracts. GSA is committed to helping buyers and sellers more effectively execute on all eligible small business opportunities, which includes our role in providing contracting data insights to the Federal Government and the public in support of these goals:   Expand Federal agency use of the Forecast of Contracting Opportunities Tool. The tool assists with acquisition planning by helping vendors learn about potential prime contracting opportunities early in the process. Improved search functionality will simplify the process for the Federal user to post and maintain opportunities. Maximizing Federal agency use of the tool and creating a single forecast for the public to access will greatly ease the burden on small businesses attempting to track opportunities across multiple sources of information.   Launch and scale Federal agency adoption of new Government-wide Procurement Equity Tool. The tool uses Federal contracting data sources to support market research focused on small disadvantaged businesses. Federal agencies can use the tool to find SDBs by geographic location, business type and category. Agencies can also find new SDBs that have registered to do business but have yet to receive a federal award.   Enhance eBuy, the Request for Quote (RFQ) platform for GSA Schedule. eBuy is a powerful and intuitive acquisition tool used by thousands of Federal agencies and military services worldwide to help save government time and money as acquisitions achieve required competition, best pricing and value. Planned and ongoing updates to eBuy include new features that benefit both buyers and sellers by creating more visibility and simplification in quoting, Request for Information (RFI), and RFQ interactions. Facilitate greater supplier diversity and contracting success through GSA acquisition products and innovation. GSA acquisition vehicles are trusted and proven entry points for small businesses to begin and find early success in the Federal marketplace. The Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) and Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) are standout sources of eligible award dollars available to small disadvantaged businesses to compete for contracts in Federal common goods and services, and in high-growth categories like information technology and solutions. GSA supports overall governmentwide procurement equity efforts by ensuring the universe of our own contracting opportunities drive innovation and are responsive to the complex needs of our customers and vendors. These actions include:   Establish and implement a new 8(a) partnership agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration. This new 8(a) partnership agreement makes it easier for Federal agencies to use GSA s Government-wide contracts, including the Federal Supply Schedules, to identify and make awards to 8(a) firms. Creation of an 8(a) 10 U.S. General Services Administration Schedule pool will allow for sole source opportunities to SDBs, which significantly reduces burden on small businesses to obtain orders and gain Federal work experience. GSA will update the solicitation to begin adding new 8(a) contractors to the Schedule, will enhance eTools to identify eligible 8(a) contractors on eBuy and GSA Advantage! and will update and roll-out training for its acquisition workforce and Federal agencies on the new process.   Create new sustainability-focused markets in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Defense. Climate risk adaptation efforts and Federal sustainability goals are positioned to deploy hundreds of millions of dollars in new acquisition opportunities, including those available to small businesses, over the near/medium term. GSA is driving new and emerging market successes in Low Embodied Carbon building materials, Zero-Emission Vehicles and supply equipment, scaling of eco-labels to reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and expediting procurement availability of environmental technologies.   Finalize solicitations and awards for new Polaris and OASIS+ contracts.3 These newly launched governmentwide IT and professional services contracts offer more opportunities for small businesses to compete for prime contracts, including small business and socioeconomic set-asides. Since 2015, GSA s current OASIS vehicle has helped Federal agencies obligate more than $67 billion. Improve accessibility and reduce administrative burden. GSA committed to reviewing 37 Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) forms and identifying six design changes to appearance and layout (e.g., limiting use of capitalization and italics, continuity of 12-point font and bolded text for readability) that could make the standard forms easier to navigate for people with dyslexia, limited vision and intellectual disabilities. GSA will redesign FAR forms and launch a public awareness campaign about the updates. For FY 2024, GSA will also increase its pledge to the AbilityOne program, a critical source for buying goods and services from suppliers who support the employment of people with disabilities.     Further implement and enhance the Post-Award Engagement (PAE) Strategy. Fiscal Year 2023 sales data for SDBs and SESBs will serve as the Year 1 baseline to evaluate the efficacy of PAE plan activities. Based on analysis, GSA will update actions for post-award interventions that address the phenomena of persistent low or no sales, including: targeted training, matchmaking industry days and technical assistance. Measuring Our Progress: Federal Procurement Equity GSA will know if we are achieving measurable results for the small business communities we serve by tracking quarterly and annual progress against key metrics, including:     increased number and percentage of disadvantaged and socioeconomic small businesses active in core GSA marketplaces; increased total dollars and percentage obligated to SDBs and SESBs relative to GSA s overall eligible annual spending;   downward trends in number and percentage of SDBs and SESBs with no or low sales;   upward trends in SDBs and SESBs average dollar value of awards and percentage of market share;   upward trends in SDBs and SESBs overall new entrants and increased participation in high-growth and emerging market segments; improved overall qualitative data results from customer and vendor surveys, focus   3 GSA is responsive to any protest decisions and remains committed to providing opportunities for small businesses while supporting Federal agencies in their small business goals. 11 groups, and training feedback. U.S. General Services Administration Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Economic Justice Strategy #2: Deliver Equitable, Accessible and Inclusive Digital Government to the American Public Barriers to Equity Although technology continues to rapidly evolve, persistent inequities in technology design and delivery   like higher false rejection rates, completion failure rates, and time burdens - disproportionately negatively impact those from historically and socially marginalized communities. Additionally, digital services very often fail to prioritize human-centered design and usability beyond compliance. This means that Americans who likely have a critical need to connect with government information and services through digital platforms also are likely to have the hardest time doing so. Examples include both lack of access to the newest hardware or good internet, which often means newer digital platforms do not perform as well (because they are not built for older devices or don t work with low bandwidth connections), or software that is not designed to work across all populations, such as lack of plain language impacting populations with limited English proficiency or poorly trained AI models causing biometric systems to perform worse for people with different ages or skin tones. GSA   through its consulting and fellowships offerings such as the Centers of Excellence and the Presidential Innovation Fellows, shared services such as Login.gov and the US Web Design System, and Federal partners in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and United States Digital Service   plays a central role in the responsible development, deployment, and procurement of technologies used by the Federal Government to communicate or interact with the public.4 GSA is committed to delivering high-impact digital services and products in a manner that improves customer experience, reduces burden, broadens access, and advances civic tech practices that are intrinsically equity-aware and community-informed. Key Actions Mitigate bias and advance responsible adoption of civic technologies, including machine learning-enabled and emerging technologies. GSA s own internal product testing processes, as well as publicly available, peer-reviewed technical research studies from academic institutions and government research partners - like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - have identified user experience disparities and efficacy gaps in machine learning and AI-enabled technologies that adversely impact users, including: people with darker skin tones, people in rural areas with low bandwidth, people using older electronic devices, nonbinary and transgender people, people with disabilities, and people whose native language is not English.5 The negative impacts listed above compound for government websites and digital services, including services that have the potential to impact rights (like access to benefits or other government services). For example, a user with darker skin tone who is more likely to live in a neighborhood with low-bandwidth internet access and have an older device is thus more likely to experience increased friction in their attempt to use a government website or service. 4 AI Guide for Government, IT Modernization Centers of Excellence; Blueprint for AI Bill of Rights, OSTP 5 Face Recognition Technology Evaluation (FRTE) Part 1: Verification (2023), NIST 12 U.S. General Services Administration   Complete the Equity Study on Remote Identity-Proofing and publish findings. GSA launched the study and is recruiting 4,000 members of the public for participation. The peer-reviewed final report will present a statistical analysis of the performance of proofing checks, like facial verification, across a number of sociodemographic factors and explore the causes behind any negative or inconclusive results. GSA will use the results of this study, in combination with findings from other Federal agency efforts, to establish recommendations and inform future product iteration, including on Login.gov.   Advance equity through civic tech shared services and large-scale modernization investments. GSA provides expertise via a portfolio of mission critical digital government projects through its universe of technologists and product managers in TTS Consulting, Presidential Innovation Fellows, U.S. Digital Corps and the Benefits Studio. The agency also supports improvements to government delivery and IT infrastructure, including automation, through investments made by the Technology Modernization Fund. These platforms are positioned to apply equity frameworks in the way government programs and services are effectively designed and delivered to the American public. Expand digital accessibility, language access, public participation and equitable user research practices. Traditional outreach, user research, data collection (including Artificial Intelligence-trained datasets), content strategy and customer experience testing methods often do not sufficiently include underrepresented groups. This means that as technology is built and deployed, those end users of the public who likely most need to connect with government information and services will often have the most difficulty accessing them. GSA will continue actions that strengthen relationships with stakeholders and meaningfully integrate the needs of communities as part of our digital services.   Strengthen relationships with underserved user communities and build capacity for research operations. Governmentwide customer experience efforts focus on improving the digital interactions of communities and individuals with accessibility needs such as physical or mental disabilities and those experiencing major life events such as recovering from disasters, emergencies or financial shock, new and expecting parents, and those planning for retirement. GSA will continue integrating usability testing and research operations capabilities, including the expansion of user compensation pilots,6 to directly track how well our digital services are working and meeting the diverse needs of the public.   Modernize GSA s high-impact7 service providers to improve digital accessibility and language access. GSA s public-facing digital assets like USA.gov, Login.gov and Vote.gov connect tens of millions of Americans to Federal services and information. GSA will continue modernization efforts to make our digital services more accessible, understandable, and easy-to-use. This includes platforming new language translations and designing from native speaker experiences, like USAGov en Espa ol, as well as driving universal design standards in partnership with U.S. Web Design System.   Develop a plain-language accessibility checklist in collaboration with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). This will enable any team developing cloud-based services and digital solutions to incorporate accessibility into their process, regardless of their expertise.

U.S. General Services Administration Measuring Our Progress: Equitable and Accessible Digital Government GSA will know if we are achieving measurable positive change in Federal public-serving digital products and services by tracking progress against key metrics, including:             reduced negative impacts (e.g., false rejection rates in biometric identity-proofing, task completion rates, slow page load times for low- and limited-bandwidth connections) and closing those efficacy gaps across sociodemographic factors increased product efficacy and higher overall scores in usability tests increased digital accessibility fluency and compliance across GSA high-impact products increased number of community-based organizations with active user research pipelines for GSA product testing increased and proportionate participation of users from underserved community groups in GSA product testing at scale increased number of available and platform-integrated non-English languages in high- impact digital services and products Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, Housing Justice and Community Investment Strategy #3: Advance Equity, Economic Security and Environmental Justice through Large-Scale Construction Projects and the Federal Buildings Footprint Barriers to Equity The Federal real estate footprint - including the 375 million rentable square feet owned and operated by GSA - has significant generational impact on communities nationwide. Federal construction projects act as anchors for economic security, reliable opportunities for good local jobs, defenses against the negative impacts of climate change, and can advance the overall livability and vitality of American communities. GSA s work often occurs in or adjacent to disadvantaged communities that have suffered from long-standing underinvestment and have dealt with historic challenges and barriers to equitable development. These communities tend to have poor transportation connectivity to job opportunities, higher exposure to many forms of pollution, and less access to green space. The impacts of this inequity are apparent in the persistent lower household income, high unemployment, and poorer health outcomes.8 In order to help overcome these barriers, GSA is executing projects with enhanced stakeholder engagement and data analysis to better inform GSA decisionmakers and project teams about local development contexts and better connect project location, design, and facility operations with the needs of those communities that will benefit from more equitable development. Projects implemented under the nearly $7 billion made available to GSA through historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) investments are poised to bolster economies with small and local business participation, improve job and jobsite quality for workers and trade labor, address sustainability and environmental justice concerns, and strengthen relationships between levels of government, Tribes, and communities. 8 Assessing the Legacies of Historical Redlining, Urban Institute (2023) 14 U.S. General Services Administration Key Actions Aid the economic success of construction industries, contractors, and labor forces. Governmentwide implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is estimated to create 800,000 good-paying jobs9, but the possibility of critical shortages in construction and craft labor could threaten the timely and successful completion of these projects.10 GSA is committed to scaling the impact of our BIL and other building modernization investments through collaboration with other Federal agencies and our industry partners.   Implement the Good Jobs Initiative partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor to create and support clear pathways for workers to high-quality, good-paying jobs in construction, maintenance, manufacturing, and operations. The actions outlined in the signed Memorandum of Understanding11 aim to support equitable and effective workforce development, including those from nontraditional and underserved labor sources; and improve job quality, standards and metrics on GSA construction sites.   Build and release new Geographic Information System (GIS) data-informed public forecasting resources for BIL and IRA related construction projects. GIS is a computer system that analyzes and displays geographically referenced information. It uses data that is attached to a unique location. By providing more visibility and transparency about where and when Federal projects are happening, GSA can help Federal contractors, trade labor, and community stakeholders effectively plan and better connect with opportunities. This effort will help more Americans, including those from underserved communities, with access to quality employment in their communities. Increase contracting opportunities for socioeconomically disadvantaged small businesses across growing markets in construction, clean energy, and sustainability. GSA will take actions aimed to maximize participation of SDB and build its small business contractor base by improving the forecasting process, strengthening relationships with existing contractors, executing its plans for industry engagement and utilizing the Governmentwide Procurement Equity Tool to identify eligible and new businesses ready to bid for work where GSA projects are located.   Achieve equitable and sustainable development impacts through data-driven insights, Federal partnerships and community engagement. New Federal integrated data mapping and urban planning resources, like the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool have provided GSA with deeper insights about community needs and challenges during the project planning process. This includes opportunities for GSA to collaborate directly with State/local governments and communities on ways to address environmental justice concerns, meet development goals, and scale impact through better and more robust coordination between Federal agencies.   Identify and announce a near-term portfolio of projects for targeted environmental justice and sustainability actions. GSA s Center for Urban Development/Good Neighbor Program will develop a priority list of site repair work at Federal buildings that would correct deficiencies in ways that also bring positive local sustainability impacts, address environmental justice concerns, and fulfill community planning goals. Relevant issues would include stormwater runoff, extreme heat, and tree canopy, as well as accessibility and improving aesthetics. These projects will provide meaningful benefit to the communities surrounding Federal properties and help to maximize the positive 9 Macroeconomic Consequences of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Moody s Analytics (November 2021) 10 Will a labor crunch derail plans to upgrade U.S. infrastructure?, McKinsey & Company (October 2022) 11 General Services Administration - Department of Labor Good Jobs Memorandum of Understanding (2023) 15 U.S. General Services Administration impact of GSA repair investments.   Continue Leveraging the Federal Thriving Communities Network12 to connect GSA stakeholder communities with additional climate and infrastructure resources. While GSA does not issue grants, it can proactively ensure that the communities we serve are better able to connect with place-based technical assistance and other IRA and BIL resources made available through Federal agency partners like U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Department of Commerce.   Complete a study on the impacts of Federal real property disposal. After it is determined that excess real property is no longer needed by the Federal Government, various statutes authorize conveyance13 to State and local governments and in some cases, to nonprofits at up to 100% discount for public benefit use. Some of the qualifying uses include public health, homeless assistance, education, park and recreation, correctional, law enforcement, and emergency management. This study will give GSA important new insights on how portfolio disposal decisions affect surrounding communities in the near and long-term. Measuring Our Progress: Equitable and Sustainable Public Buildings Footprint GSA will know if we are achieving measurable positive impacts in the communities where Federal construction projects and buildings are located by tracking progress against key metrics, including:     increased diversity in the supplier base, including broadened participation from Tribal and disadvantaged businesses contracted to Federal construction projects and increased total dollars awarded to these businesses as a percentage of project value increased number of small and socioeconomic businesses, including new entrants, awarded contracts in the region where Federal projects are located increased number of Project Labor Agreements executed     overall improved job and jobsite quality scores across GSA portfolio projects   increased and more accessible pathways to training and employment opportunities in regions where GSA projects are located increased initiation and execution of community development goals established during Planning Outreach and Partnership engagements     number of GSA community stakeholders who are awarded place-based assistance grants through Thriving Communities opportunities; indicators of reduced burden in disadvantaged Census tracts with GSA environmental justice ameliorations Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Health Equity, Economic Justice, Global Equality Strategy #4: Advance Equity and Effectiveness of Federal Programs Through Rigorous Review, Evaluation and Continuous Improvement Barriers to Equity The Federal Government s exploration of the equitable and effective deployment of benefits, resources and critical relief programs in the near and long term, particularly after national emergencies, is an essential part of how the government performs continuous improvement of 12 https://www.transportation.gov/Federal-interagency-thriving-communities-network 13 https://disposal.gsa.gov/s/PBC 16 U.S. General Services Administration its functions and works better for all Americans. As an example, Federal resources deployed to address immediate needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic faced challenges in equitably reaching communities who were already suffering from legacy disparities in and outcomes across race, class, and geography; these systemic inequities were further exacerbated by the pandemic.14 By conducting more frequent and rigorous evaluation of both the methods used to deliver government resources and the impacts of Federal programs on the public, the Federal Government has the potential to more fully understand if programs are working as intended, better interrupt bias further upstream and modernize systems for greater efficacy   with the ultimate goal of meeting the needs of communities, particularly the most vulnerable, when it matters the most. Undertaking evaluation can be expensive, time consuming, and may require Federal agencies to build capacity for data or research needs before being able to initiate this important work. Additionally, once evaluations are completed, Federal agencies face challenges with resources or infrastructure to act on key findings; and results from evaluations currently lack communication strategies that can more easily raise awareness for the public and catalyze implementation, including across non-Federal stakeholders who also benefit from these insights. Key Actions Complete, publish and share learnings from governmentwide equity evaluations. GSA serves a unique function in the government by providing other Federal agencies with help building and using evidence. We partner with Federal agencies to answer priority questions with rigorous evaluation methods and administrative data. We design and conduct evaluations of existing programs - including life-saving programs like disaster relief, emergency assistance, and crisis hotlines - and recommend evidence-based program changes, with the ultimate goal of improving how the government is serving all Americans.   Increase the number of Federal agencies and programs initiating equity evaluations. GSA currently partners with a handful of Federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Treasury and the U.S. Department of Education. GSA will increase its capacity for new evaluation agreements and work to recruit additional Federal agencies and programs to the service. Additionally, GSA will partner with the White House and interagency councils to bolster Federal agency capacity and readiness to undertake evaluations.   Conduct public engagement and increase awareness of equity evaluation findings. The conclusions and recommendations generated from these evaluation efforts are not only useful to the Federal Government. They provide important insights to State and local governments who coordinate downstream Federal resources to communities and act as a public accountability tool to the communities themselves. GSA will undertake a strategic communications campaign to raise awareness of key findings and ensure the research has maximum impact through its scaled application by end users. Measuring Our Progress: Equitable Administration of Government Programs GSA will know if we are effectively supporting positive change in Federal programs and the equitable delivery of government by several key factors, including:   number of Federal agencies and programs undertaking equity evaluations 14 How COVID-19 Has Magnified Pre-existing Inequalities in the US, Boston University (2022) 17   Number of Federal agencies and programs implementing updates based on findings increased number of people and communities reached by engagement and public   outreach actions about evaluation findings indicators of reduced burden and improved access where Federal program delivery has been revised based on evaluation findings   U.S. General Services Administration Whole-of-Government Equity Objective: Civil Rights, Economic Justice Strategy #5: Advance Equitable Access to Opportunity and Federal Resources for Local Communities and Minority Serving Institutions Barriers to Equity Rural, socioeconomically underserved, and historically disinvested communities, including Tribes and institutions that serve disadvantaged and minority populations like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), disproportionately rely on Federal goods and services to bridge critical resource gaps.15 Yet barriers to information, administrative burdens in navigating government processes, capacity and infrastructure gaps to meet government requirements, and equitable access to resource pathways prevent communities from fully realizing the available benefits from Federal support and partnership. Key Actions Deliver more Federal goods and products to American communities in critical need through the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program.16 Administered by GSA, the program enables certain non-Federal organizations to obtain personal property that the Federal Government no longer needs. This property includes computers, office equipment and furniture, motor vehicles, aircraft, vessels, scientific devices and heavy machinery. GSA facilitates the distribution of millions of dollars in surplus Federal goods annually and the program is administered in each of the 56 States and territories by a State Agency for Surplus Property (SASP). In addition, State agencies, cities, local governments, Tribal governments, and non-profit organizations for the purposes of public health or education or services to veterans may obtain Federal surplus personal property through the donation program. Examples of recipients of property donations include, but are not limited to: public works departments, public health departments, childcare centers, homeless shelters, school districts, food banks, and HBCUs or other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs).   Establish a plan to conduct proactive reviews for the 56 State Agencies for Surplus Property to ensure their compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with a goal of 14 SASPs for review each fiscal year. GSA s Office of Civil Rights is responsible for GSA s administration of Title VI and will work to increase equitable access to programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance from GSA. Initiate an engagement and outreach plan to raise awareness in local communities about resources available through their State Agency for Surplus Property. GSA   15 Public and Private Investments and Divestments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, American Council on Education (ACE), UNCF (2019) 16 GSA guide: Federal Personal Property for Reuse and Sale 18 will integrate technical assistance and public education about the Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program alongside other regular community engagement efforts that the agency coordinates. U.S. General Services Administration Advance procurement opportunities and partnerships between Federal Agencies and Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions. HBCUs and MSIs provide vital support to communities through higher education, cutting edge research, public health ecosystems, pathways to quality employment, and well-being for economically and socially underserved Americans. The Federal Government can better benefit from the deep and rich expertise of these institutions and can improve pathways to more robust and meaningful partnership with them, including through Federal contracting.   Increase the number of eligible HBCUs and MSIs on the GSA Multiple Award Schedule. The MAS is a long-term contract with commercial entities that provides Federal agencies with billions of dollars in annual access to common products and services needed by the government. GSA plans to conduct outreach to eligible institutions currently without MAS contracts, conduct training and provide technical assistance on how to get on the MAS, and host HBCU-focused industry days, matchmaking events and other strategic engagements to raise awareness and help better position HBCUs and MSIs to successfully do business with the Federal Government   Launch and scale adoption of new GSA public digital resource for MSIs. GSA s new public website to support Minority Serving Institutions will aggregate information and resources that help both Federal agencies and MSIs develop and sustain partnerships or contracting agreements. Resources include market research, capabilities assessments, support for exploring joint venture and other contractor team agreements and data tools to help advance supplier diversity across Federal Government procurement Measuring Our Progress: Equitable Access to Federal Resources GSA will know if we are effectively supporting positive change in Federal programs and the equitable delivery of government by several key factors, including:   number of completed civil rights SASP compliance reviews   increased number of people, communities, and MSIs reached by engagement and public outreach actions increased number of underserved communities, organizations, or geographic areas that that seek to participate in the Federal surplus goods program indicators of reduced burden and improved access where program compliance reviews and any required updates have been implemented Increased number of MSI and HBCUs participating in Federal contracts Increased number of overall Federal contracting dollars obligated to MSIs and HBCUs         19",

Background. Lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American interests should not have access to our Nation s secrets, nor should their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts. My Administration must also take appropriate and nec- essary measures to guard against the actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that arise when the Government funds, engages with, or otherwise devotes resources to law firms and their clients that engage in conduct undermining critical American interests and priorities. I have determined that action is necessary to address the significant risks, egregious conduct, and conflicts of interest associated with Susman Godfrey LLP (Susman). Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections. Susman also funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military through the injection of political and radical ideology, and it supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race. Susman itself engages in unlawful discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race. For example, Susman administers a program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities only to  students of color.  My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimi- nation perpetrated in the name of  diversity, equity, and inclusion  policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds. Sec. 2. Security Clearance Review. (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applica- ble law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Susman, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Susman. The heads of agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. Sec. 3. Contracting. (a) To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Susman and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. (b) The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with Susman or with entities that disclose doing business with Susman under subsection (a) of this section.

Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Susman or with entities that do business with Susman effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. Sec. 4. Racial Discrimination. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP). Sec. 5. Personnel. (a) The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Susman when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Susman employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States. (b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Susman, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

      "phase1_response": "## Policy Analysis: GSA Equity Action Plan vs. Executive Order 14263\n\n### 1. Policy Summary\nThe GSA Equity Action Plan for 2023 outlines the agency's commitment to delivering equitable, accessible, and inclusive government services. The plan emphasizes a \"people-centered approach to government\" and commits to making \"meaningful equity impacts\" across GSA's operations, including investments in American jobs, digital government services, sustainability initiatives, and community development. Administrator Carnahan frames equity as a core element of GSA's mission to deliver efficient and effective government services.\n\n### 2. Executive Order Summary\nExecutive Order 14263 targets Susman Godfrey LLP specifically but establishes broader principles against law firms and entities that the Administration views as engaging in activities \"detrimental to critical American interests.\" The order explicitly opposes what it characterizes as unlawful discrimination perpetrated under \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" policies, citing as an example programs that offer opportunities exclusively to \"students of color.\" The order commits the Administration to \"ending such unlawful discrimination\" and ensuring federal benefits align with administration policies.\n\n### 3. Detailed Impact Analysis\nThis executive order significantly affects GSA's Equity Action Plan in several ways:\n\n**Direct Policy Conflict**: The executive order explicitly targets \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" policies as potentially constituting \"unlawful discrimination.\" GSA's plan is fundamentally built around equity principles and commitments.\n\n**Programmatic Implications**: While the order specifically cites Susman Godfrey's race-based programs as problematic, the language suggests broader opposition to DEI initiatives across federal operations. GSA's equity-focused programs, partnerships, and contracting practices may be subject to review and potential elimination.\n\n**Mission Realignment**: The order requires federal benefits and activities to support \"the laws and policies of the United States\" as interpreted by the current Administration. This effectively mandates a reassessment of all equity-focused initiatives within GSA's portfolio.\n\n**Funding and Resource Allocation**: GSA's equity investments, including community partnerships and targeted programs mentioned in the plan, may need to be restructured or discontinued if they're deemed inconsistent with the executive order's directive.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\n\n1. **Immediate Review**: Conduct comprehensive audit of all GSA equity programs, initiatives, and policies to identify potential conflicts with the executive order.\n\n2. **Legal Analysis**: Engage GSA General Counsel to review all equity-related activities for potential legal vulnerabilities under the new directive.\n\n3. **Program Suspension**: Consider placing equity-specific programs on hold pending further guidance from the Administration.\n\n4. **Policy Revision**: Prepare revised versions of the Equity Action Plan that align with the executive order's requirements, potentially reframing initiatives around \"merit-based\" or \"non-discriminatory\" principles.\n\n5. **Stakeholder Communication**: Develop communication strategy for internal and external stakeholders regarding changes to equity commitments.\n\n6. **Training and Guidance**: Implement new training for GSA staff on revised policies and compliance requirements.\n\n**Final Determination: [Affected]**",

The executive order:\n   - Does not modify equity program requirements or funding\n   - Does not change diversity and inclusion mandates\n   - Does not alter GSA's service delivery methods or accessibility standards\n   - Creates only a narrow restriction on one legal entity's federal eligibili",
      "phase2_response": "**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**\nThe policy is GSA's Equity Action Plan, which focuses on promoting equity, accessibility, and inclusion in government service delivery. The domain is **federal agency equity initiatives and inclusive government operations**.\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**\nExecutive Order 14263 addresses restrictions on federal engagement with the law firm Susman Godfrey, prohibiting their access to classified information and federal contracts due to conduct deemed detrimental to American interests. The domain is **federal contracting restrictions and national security measures targeting specific legal entities**.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nThese domains are fundamentally different in scope and purpose:\n- The policy addresses broad systemic equity goals across GSA operations\n- The executive order creates narrow, entity-specific restrictions on a single law firm\n\nThe order does not directly regulate equity programs, diversity initiatives, or inclusive service delivery methods that form the core of GSA's Equity Action Plan.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment**\nWhile the phase1_flag indicates \"Affected,\" my analysis suggests this may be an overcategorization. The connection between restricting one law firm's federal access and GSA's comprehensive equity initiatives is tenuous at best.\n\n**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: GSA's Equity Action Plan operates in the domain of organizational diversity, equitable service delivery, and inclusive government practices aimed at better serving all Americans.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: EO 14263 operates in the domain of federal procurement restrictions and national security measures, specifically targeting Susman Godfrey's eligibility for federal contracts and classified access.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or meaningful indirect impact. The executive order:\n   - Does not modify equity program requirements or funding\n   - Does not change diversity and inclusion mandates\n   - Does not alter GSA's service delivery methods or accessibility standards\n   - Creates only a narrow restriction on one legal entity's federal eligibility\n\n4. **Supporting Language**: The EO's focus on \"lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American interests\" and restrictions on \"access to our Nation's secrets\" and \"Federal taxpayer funds or contracts\" is entirely separate from the policy's equity language about \"delivering efficient, effective government\" and taking \"a people-centered approach to government.\"\n\n5. **Edge Case Considerations**: Even considering potential indirect effects through GSA's procurement processes, the restriction on one law firm would not materially impact GSA's broader equity mission or the implementation of inclusive practices across the agency's operations.\n\nThe executive order addresses federal contracting eligibility for a specific entity, while the policy addresses systemic equity goals\u2014these operate in distinct spheres with no substantive intersection.",

The model's structured approach with explicit domain analysis and detailed impact assessment provides clearer reasoning pathways. While the SME's justification is more concise and strategically focused, the model's version offers better analytical rigor and would be more useful for policy implementation guidance. The model successfully captures the essence of the SME's reasoning while expanding it with more systematic analysis."

Purpose The purpose of this Procurement Instructional Bulletin (PIB) is to outline the guidelines for implementation and use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool. 2. Background The Skill Enhancement & Employee Development (SEED) program was created to provide the 1102 contract specialist community with a solid foundation, minimize acquisition skill gaps, and increase the overall knowledge and skills of the acquisition workforce. As part of SEED, the PATH tool was developed to give those in the 1102 acquisition community with little to no contracting knowledge a tool to learn and test their knowledge using scenario based exercises. The tool consists of various exercises categorized into the following modules: Pre-Award, Award, Post-Award, and Other. 3. Effective Date This PIB is effective on the date signed. The exercises that make up the training tool will be updated, as needed, to address any regulatory changes or Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) policy guidance 1800 F Street, NW Washington, DC 20405-0002 www.gsa.gov DocuSign Envelope ID: 3DF787F3-F9CB-4240-B6F6-E46C4D13456610/28/2022 revisions. 4. Cancellation Date This PIB will remain in effect until canceled. 5. Affected or Canceled Policies None. 6. Applicability This PIB applies to all Public Buildings Service (PBS) 1102s, including interns hired under the PBS Acquisition Intern Program. Use of the PATH tool is mandatory for new employees at the GS-09 level and below who are hired on or after the effective date of this tool. The tool is optional for those employees above the GS-09 level. 7. Exceptions The requirements of this PIB will not be applicable to employees who are participating under the Emerging Leaders Program (ELP), until they are converted to the 1102 series. 8. Instructions and Procedures Exercises & Answer Keys The exercises are broken into four modules: Pre-award, Award, Post-Award, and Other. There are two documents for each topic: the exercise and answer key. Links to all of the documents can be found on Attachment 1 - PATH Tool Table of Contents. Users should complete the exercises in chronological order. Some exercises have a service and construction type scenario. In those cases, users can elect to complete one or both exercises. The users will access the exercise, read the scenario, if one is included, and use the policy and guidance references to answer the questions. Only the regional supervisors will have access to the answer key documents. Upon completion of each exercise, users must work with their supervisor, or designee, to review their responses and compare them to the answer key. This will help ensure that users understand the general concepts of the exercise topic. 2 DocuSign Envelope ID: 3DF787F3-F9CB-4240-B6F6-E46C4D134566 New employees will be expected to complete the entire tool within 18 months of their start date. At a minimum, the first module (Pre-Award) is to be completed within the first year. FAI CSOD & CLPs Upon completion of all exercises in a module, users are to ensure that their completion is indicated in FAI Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD). To do this, supervisors are to complete the survey form linked as Attachment 2 - PATH Tool Supervisor Confirmation of Completion. Upon receipt, OAM will update FAI CSOD. This must be done for completion of each module. OAM will use this information to track completion of the tool. This process will also assist to provide continuous learning points (CLPs) to users who are eligible to receive them. 9.

      "phase1_response": "## Policy Analysis: GSA PIB 23-01 vs. Presidential Proclamation 10885\n\n### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text (GSA PIB 23-01)\nThis Procurement Instructional Bulletin establishes mandatory use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool for GSA's Public Buildings Service. The policy requires all new PBS 1102 contract specialists at GS-09 level and below to use this training tool, which consists of scenario-based exercises across Pre-Award, Award, Post-Award, and Other modules. The tool was developed under the SEED program to provide foundational contracting knowledge and minimize acquisition skill gaps. The policy is effective immediately and applies to all PBS 1102s, including acquisition interns.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text (Presidential Proclamation 10885)\nThis Presidential Proclamation orders that the United States flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day (January 20, 2025) and all future Inauguration Days at the White House, public buildings, military installations, naval vessels, and U.S. facilities abroad. The proclamation temporarily overrides a previous order (Proclamation 10876) that had flags at half-staff in honor of former President Jimmy Carter's death. After Inauguration Day ends, flags will return to half-staff until the 30-day mourning period concludes.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability\nThe Presidential Proclamation does **not apply** to GSA PIB 23-01. These documents address entirely different subject matters:\n\n- **GSA PIB 23-01** governs internal GSA training requirements for acquisition workforce development\n- **Presidential Proclamation 10885** addresses flag display protocols for ceremonial purposes\n\nThe executive order specifically targets flag display at federal facilities and has no bearing on:\n- GSA's acquisition training programs\n- Professional development requirements for federal employees\n- Internal agency operational policies\n- Procurement instructional guidance\n\nThere is no intersection between flag display ceremonial requirements and acquisition workforce training mandates.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\nNo compliance actions are required because the Presidential Proclamation does not affect GSA PIB 23-01. GSA should continue implementing the PATH tool training requirements as outlined in the original policy bulletin without any modifications related to this proclamation.\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

Specifically, it addresses the mandatory use of the Professional Acquisition Training Highway (PATH) tool for GSA's Public Buildings Service 1102 contract specialists to enhance their contracting knowledge and skills through the SEED program.\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**\nProclamation 10885 addresses ceremonial flag protocol, specifically mandating that the U.S. flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day at federal buildings, military installations, naval vessels, and other government facilities nationwide.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nThese two documents operate in completely separate domains:\n- The policy governs internal workforce development and training procedures for acquisition professionals\n- The executive order establishes ceremonial flag display requirements for federal facilities\n\nThere is no operational, procedural, or substantive overlap between procurement training protocols and flag display ceremonies.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment Context**\nThe Phase 1 flag of \"Not Affected\" aligns with the clear separation between these domains. No reasonable interpretation connects acquisition training requirements with ceremonial flag protocols.\n\n**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: Federal procurement and acquisition workforce training - specifically the implementation of the PATH tool for GSA PBS contract specialists under the SEED program.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: Ceremonial flag display protocol for federal facilities on Inauguration Day.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact between these domains.

The model demonstrates good analytical structure by clearly separating the policy domains and systematically explaining why no intersection exists. The model's approach is more verbose but covers the same logical ground as the SME's more succinct analysis. The additional specificity about procurement training elements shows the model understood the policy content well, though this level of detail wasn't necessary for the core determination. Overall, the model's reasoning process is sound and would likely be considered reliable for policy compliance analysis."
