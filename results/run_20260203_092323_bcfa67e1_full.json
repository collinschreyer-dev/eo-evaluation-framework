L. No. 117-169, was enacted in August 2022. The IRA made the single largest investment in climate and energy in American history. The IRA will help the United States tackle the climate crisis, advance environmental justice, and secure our Nation s position as a world leader in domestic clean energy manufacturing. This law puts the United States on a pathway to achieving the Administration s climate goals, including a net zero operational emissions federal building portfolio by 2045, and net zero emissions procurement by 2050. Statutory Text Public Law No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818 (Aug. 16, 2022) SEC. 60502. ASSISTANCE FOR FEDERAL BUILDINGS. In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated for fiscal year 2022, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $250,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2031, to be deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund established under section 592 of title 40, United States Code, for measures necessary to convert facilities of the Administrator of General Services to high-performance green buildings (as defined in section 401 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17061)). SEC. 60503. USE OF LOW-CARBON MATERIALS. (a) APPROPRIATION. In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated for fiscal year 2022, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $2,150,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2026, to be deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund established under section 592 of title 40, United States Code, to acquire and install materials and products for use in the construction or alteration of buildings under the jurisdiction, custody, and control of the General Services Administration that have substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated with all relevant stages of production, use, and disposal as compared to estimated industry averages of similar materials or products, as determined by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. (b) DEFINITION OF GREENHOUSE GAS. In this section, the term  greenhouse gas  means the air pollutants carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. SEC. 60504. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated to the Administrator of General Services for fiscal year 2022, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $975,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2026, to be deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund established under section 592 of title 40, United States Code, for emerging and sustainable technologies, and related sustainability and environmental programs. Approach To Low Embodied Carbon Material Internal GSA Use Only - Page 4 As indicated above, IRA Section 60503 provides GSA with $2.15 billion for acquisition and installation of construction materials and products with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions as compared to estimated industry averages, as determined by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In December 2022, EPA issued an Interim Determination which provided GSA with guidance on how to identify clean building materials. Consistent with standard GSA practice and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and taking extensive industry feedback into consideration, GSA issued IRA Low Embodied Carbon (LEC) asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel materials requirements for use in acquiring compliant materials. In addition to these materials, the requirements apply to certain product assemblies if at least 80% of the assembly s total cost or total weight comprises materials that meet the LEC Requirements. In addition to acquiring and installing LEC materials, GSA needs to acquire and install high- performance green building measures and emerging and sustainable technologies. To accomplish this end, GSA needs to generate implementing solicitations and contract documents. This Desk Guide provides guidance instructing Contracting Officers and PBS Project Teams (i.e., Project Executives, Project Managers, Architect/Engineers, and Construction Managers) on incorporating IRA-funded work into required solicitations and agreements.1 This guidance supplements, and does not eliminate, other generally applicable procurement requirements (e.g., competition requirements and the Buy American and Trade Agreement Acts). Questions Questions regarding this guidance can be directed to pbsoampolicy@gsa.gov. The Office of Acquisition Management s OAM IRA Toolkit on GSA s National Acquisition Resource Center contains the most up-to-date IRA acquisition information, guidance, and tools. Questions regarding the overall IRA Program can be directed to IRA Program Questions Google Form, or directly to John.Dennis@gsa.gov. IRA Program Resources can also be found at: Inflation Reduction Act Program. Instructions for Solicitation of Construction Projects Involving IRA Funding Synopses, Solicitations, Agreements, Statements of Work and Specifications involving IRA funding must reflect a number of new elements. Specific requirements will depend on which IRA fund sources will be used: high performance green building funding, low embodied 1 Although construction solicitations and contracts are the principal focus of the Desk Guide, design and construction management requirements are also covered below. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 5 carbon construction material funding and/or emerging and sustainable technology funding.   Contracting Officers and PBS Project Teams responsible for procurements involving IRA funding must tailor procurement documents, including PBS Construction Template Solicitations and Agreements, as discussed below. Note: Contracting officers may not need all of the below language for a given project; for example, a project not involving LEC materials will not require LEC-specific evaluation factors and contract clauses, etc.   For projects utilizing indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) vehicles, the substance of the below guidance should be addressed and incorporated to the extent practicable.   For noncompetitive projects (e.g., 8(a) sole source), the substance of the below guidance should be addressed and incorporated to the extent practicable. In lieu of a LEC evaluation factor, see  Noncompetitive Proposal Evaluation Requirements  section.   Blue text indicates passages required for insertion into operative procurement documents. This coloring should be changed to black once transferred to procurement documents.   Appendix A - IRA LEC Project Checklist contains a step-by-step checklist of solicitation and contract activities for LEC construction work covered by this guidance. I. Pre-Solicitation Requirements for Projects Requiring LEC Construction Materials In publicizing a Synopsis for a Proposed LEC Project Contract Action, Contracting Officers should include prominently-displayed synopsis language as follows. (Note: This section is not applicable to projects utilizing IDIQ vehicles.) In addition to the construction opportunity reflected herein, GSA is seeking suppliers and manufacturers that are interested in supplying low embodied carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel materials for the project. Suppliers and manufacturers of materials meeting GSA s Inflation Reduction Act Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements may submit an Expression of Interest to the contact below no later than <<CO to insert date>>. Expressions of Interest should indicate materials available and global warming potential values reflected in materials  environmental product declarations. Submission of an expression of interest grants GSA your permission to publish your firm s contact information and offerings for use by potential offerors on GSA construction requirements. Supplier and manufacturer contact information will be published in an informational amendment issued by GSA and, potentially, in other fora. By participating in the competition, offerors consent to unrestricted GSA use of supplier names and the GWP values associated with supplier materials. Such information may be disclosed publicly or used to inform other low embodied carbon procurement Internal GSA Use Only - Page 6 activities. Technical solutions, supplier pricing, and supplier-offeror terms and conditions will not be shared. Any objection shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer by the due date for offers and shall adhere to 41 C.F.R.   105-60.601. As indicated by the text above, Contracting Officers shall collect, summarize, and provide contact information, available materials, and global warming potential values from Expressions of Interest as an informational amendment to the solicitation. This document shall include the following statement: Market research resources for identifying qualifying materials may include, but are not limited to, ASTM International s EPD Page, Building Transparency s Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3), ICC Evaluation Service s EPD Directory, EPD International AB s EPD Library, the National Asphalt Paving Association s Emerald Eco- Label EPD Tool, the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association s Concrete EPDs page, NSF's Search for EPDs tool, and UL s SPOT product catalog and the Builtcold website.

The Government makes no representation or warranty concerning the quality, performance, availability or suitability of any organization, business, material or product. II. Solicitation Requirements A. Notification of Use of IRA Funds The Solicitation shall be amended by adding the below text to the cover page or similarly prominent location in the front of the Solicitation: Note: The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), Pub. L. No. 117-169, enacted in August 2022, provided GSA with significant funding for (a) measures necessary to convert facilities to high-performance green buildings, (b) acquisition and installation of construction materials and products with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions, and (c) emerging and sustainable technologies. The Contract resulting from this Solicitation will be funded in part by IRA appropriations, and it contains numerous IRA-specific requirements. Requirements include, but are not limited to, requirements regarding pricing, invoicing, submittals, materials, and construction. Offerors shall carefully review this Solicitation, the Agreement, the Statement of Work, the Specifications, and the Drawings. Offerors are responsible for accurately pricing and, if successful, fully performing all Contract requirements. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 7 If the contract will be funded in whole or in part with GSA s IRA LEC appropriation and will be procured on a competitive basis, add this sentence before the final sentence of the above passage: In addition, please note that this Solicitation contains an evaluation factor favoring certain construction materials with the lowest possible levels of embodied carbon. B. Pricing Instructions The Solicitation s Price Proposal instructions shall be amended by adding the below text to the Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Additional Proposal Requirements narrative (typically Section II.C.4): GSA is required to track spending for each of the three appropriations it received under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) -- for low-embodied carbon (LEC) materials, emerging and sustainable technologies, and high-performance green building measures -- and has established  budget activities  for each of these appropriations. A contract line item number (CLIN) for each of these budget activities has been included in the Agreement as necessary. In addition, subCLINs will be used to track spending on each of the LEC materials designated for IRA funding -- asphalt, concrete, glass, and steel. Offerors must include separate prices for IRA work under the corresponding IRA CLINs and subCLINs. Amounts for each IRA CLIN should reflect all expenses necessary to accomplish acquisition and installation of IRA work elements. A list of possible expenses follows below; this list is not exhaustive.   Expenses of acquiring and transporting products and materials required for IRA- funded work to the construction site;   Labor, general and administrative expenses, and overhead and profit reasonably attributable to installation of IRA-funded work;   Expenses for materials, tools, riggings and equipment (including safety equipment) required to install IRA-funded work;   Design, submittal and documentation expenses reasonably attributable to IRA- funded work;   Demolition and disposal expenses reasonably necessary for and attributable to IRA-funded work   Expenses necessary to return space to its condition preceding IRA-funded work;   Environmental remediation expenses required in execution of IRA-funded work; and   Phasing and commissioning expenses reasonably attributable to IRA-funded work. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 8 Note: In consultation with assigned OGC Counsel, Contracting Officers and PBS Project Teams should consider adding additional detail on specific necessary expenses associated with the project. C. Best Value Tradeoff The Solicitation s Method of Award shall be amended by adding the below text to the Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Evaluation of Offers narrative (typically Section VI.A.2): Non-Price Factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Total Evaluated Price. D. Technical Evaluation Factor for Projects Requiring LEC Construction Materials GSA s IRA LEC asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements establish numeric global warming potential (GWP) limits for each of the EPA-approved construction material categories: concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel, and glass (IRA-Eligible Materials). For each material, GWP limits have been established for the best performing 20% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 20% Limits), the best performing 40% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 40% Limits), and better than industry average (Better Than Average Limit). When procuring construction projects requiring concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel and/or glass, Contracting Officers will utilize a technical evaluation factor that favors provision of IRA- Eligible Materials with the lowest possible GWP. Instructional language and an evaluation factor template are provided below. For an example of how to establish the table and calculate the offeror s score, please refer to the IRA Solicitation Sustainability Evaluation Factor Example slides. Key Considerations:   Contracting Officers shall work with PBS Project Teams to remove any IRA-Eligible Material present in the below evaluation factor that is inapplicable to the project s anticipated material needs.   Contracting Officers shall work with PBS Project Teams to develop LEC Material Evaluation Weights for individual materials to reflect the relative approximate cost of the materials required for the project. LEC Material Evaluation Weights must add up to 100%.   Separately, the Overall Weight of the factor relative to other factors (e.g., Past Performance, Prior Experience) shall be at least 15%.   Contracting Officers shall utilize the IRA Sustainability Factor Table in solicitations, which provides Offeror Instructions, a table with all materials and built-in calculations, and an example of a completed table. Internal GSA Use Only - Page 9   Depending on market research, certain IRA-Eligible Materials may be required to meet Top 20% Limits (see Market Research and Top 20% Materials, below). Market Research and Top 20% Materials Where market research indicates, and the CIPMO confirms, that certain IRA-Eligible Materials with GWP values at or better than Top 20% Limits are or should be available for a project, Contracting Officers shall substitute the following language for the first paragraph under Technical Acceptability, below: Offerors will only meet the standard for technical acceptability under this Factor if (1) they commit to furnish IRA-Eligible [INSERT CATEGORIES OF IRA-ELIGIBLE MATERIALS THAT MUST MEET TOP 20% LIMITS] with a GWP better (lower) than such materials  Top 20% Limits; and (2) they commit to furnish all other required IRA- Eligible Materials with a GWP better (lower) than each IRA-Eligible Material s Better Than Average Limit. NOTE: Where potential offerors indicate that such IRA-Eligible Materials meeting Top 20% Limits are NOT available and, based on the Contracting Officer s and CIPMO s review, these indications appear well founded, the Contracting Officer may consider issuing a solicitation amendment relaxing the Top 20% Limit requirements for those materials, permitting submission of materials meeting Top 40% Limits or Better than Average Limits. Evaluation Factor The Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Technical Proposal narrative (typically Section II.D) shall be amended by adding the below evaluation factor (Note: For two-step Design/Build procurements, this factor should be utilized in Phase 2). Evaluation Factor # ___: Sustainability Background and Overview This project is funded in part by Section 60503 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which provides funding for purchase of construction materials with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions. GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements establish numeric global warming potential (GWP) limits for certain EPA- approved construction materials: concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel, and glass (IRA- Eligible Materials). For each material, GWP limits have been established for the best performing 20% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 20% Limits), the best performing 40% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 40% Limits), and better than industry average (Better Than Average Limit). Internal GSA Use Only - Page 10 This Evaluation Factor calls for Offeror commitments to furnishing IRA-Eligible Materials with the lowest possible GWP values. IRA Limit Commitments proposed under this evaluation factor will be incorporated into the successful offeror s resultant contract. Individual materials  GWP values may be found on individual manufacturers  environmental product declarations (EPDs) (see the sam.gov presolicitation notice for some publicly-available tools that may help identify potential suppliers). EPDs must meet the standards reflected in GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements (see Compliance Documentation criteria listed for each IRA-Eligible Material). Technical Acceptability Offerors will only meet the standard for technical acceptability under this Factor if they commit to furnish all required IRA-Eligible Materials with a GWP better (lower) than each IRA-Eligible Material s Better Than Average Limit. Scoring Offerors meeting the standard for technical acceptability, above, will receive a number of Raw Scores, one for each IRA-Eligible Material required by the Contract:   Offerors will receive a Raw Score of 90 for each IRA-Eligible Material commitment that is better (lower) than GSA s Top 20% Limits.   Offerors will receive a Raw Score of 40 for each IRA-Eligible Material commitment that is only better (lower) than GSA s Top 40% Limits.   Offerors will receive a Raw Score of 20 for each IRA-Eligible Material commitment that is only better (lower) than GSA s Better Than Average Limit. Offerors shall complete the  IRA Sustainability Factor Table  attached to this solicitation by filling out the applicable IRA Limit they commit to meet for each IRA- Eligible Material. Based upon the offeror s selection in the  IRA Limit Commitment  column, the associated Raw Score, a Preliminary Weighted Score, and the Preliminary Total Weighted Score will be automatically calculated. In addition, for each IRA-Eligible Material identified in the IRA Sustainability Factor Table, offerors shall submit EPDs listing that material s GWP. Such EPDs must meet the standards reflected in GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements (see Compliance Documentation criteria listed for each IRA-Eligible Material). Raw Score Supplement Offerors will receive a supplemental 10 points on Raw Scores for each IRA-Eligible Material where the material s submitted EPD reflects the lowest GWP value received in the competition for that material. For instance, where two offerors propose materials meeting the Top 20% Limit for glass, and Offeror A submits a glass EPD reflecting a Internal GSA Use Only - Page 11 GWP value lower than that reflected in Offeror B s glass EPD, Offeror A and B will receive raw scores of 100 and 90 for that material, respectively. During evaluations, the Government will add Raw Score Supplements, if any, to offeror s Preliminary Weighted Scores to calculate Final Weighted Scores. In the event of a tie for lowest-GWP values for a given material, those tied offerors will all receive the Raw Score Supplement for that material. Note 1: By submitting an offer, Offeror consents to unrestricted GSA use of supplier names and the GWP values associated with supplier materials. Such information may be disclosed publicly or used to inform other low embodied carbon procurement activities. Technical solutions, supplier pricing and supplier-offeror terms and conditions will not be shared. Any objection shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer by the due date for offers and shall adhere to 41 C.F.R.   105-60.601. Note 2: For each offeror that is unable to submit any of the compliant EPDs by the proposal due date, the offeror shall submit a statement for each such missing compliant EPD (a) certifying that it is unable to submit a compliant EPD by the proposal due date, and (b) promising to submit a compliant EPD within 120 days from the contract award ((a) and (b) collectively constituting an  EPD Pledge ). Failure by an offeror to submit either a compliant EPD or an EPD Pledge (as described in the immediately preceding sentence) for each IRA-Eligible Material listed in the IRA Sustainability Factor Table by the proposal due date shall result in the offeror s proposal being unacceptable. Offerors submitting an EPD Pledge in lieu of a compliant EPD for a given IRA-Eligible Material will not be eligible for a Raw Score Supplement for that material, as described above. Any awardee that submitted an EPD Pledge in lieu of a compliant EPD for a given IRA- Eligible Material will still be bound by IRA Limit Commitments made in their IRA Sustainability Factor Table. Note as well that the contract resulting from this solicitation shall have the following provision:  Within 120 days after contract award, the Contractor shall submit a compliant EPD for any IRA-Eligible Material for which the Contractor was unable to submit a compliant EPD by the proposal due date (if any). Such EPD must reflect GWP values that comply with the IRA Limit Commitments incorporated into the contract. GSA shall not issue a Notice to Proceed with construction services to the Contractor until the Contractor has submitted a compliant EPD for each IRA-Eligible Material for which the Contractor was unable to submit a compliant EPD by the proposal due date.  The Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201, CMc201, DB201-2) Non-Price Factors text (typically Section VI.F.) shall be amended by adding the below evaluation factor, tailored as indicated (Weight shall be at least 15%): Evaluation Factor # ___: Sustainability Weight [INSERT (see above)]% Internal GSA Use Only - Page 12 (1) The Sustainability Factor will be scored as outlined in Section [INSERT], above. (2) GSA will verify Offeror s scoring and that IRA Limits are supported by environmental product declarations (EPDs) from proposed suppliers. (3) GSA will verify that Offeror s EPDs adhere to EPD standards reflected in GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements (see Compliance Documentation criteria listed for each IRA-Eligible Material). (4) GSA will make any scoring adjustments necessary to correct patent errors. Once GSA has verified the Offeror s scoring and, if necessary, made any corrections, the overall weighted score will be assigned an adjectival rating, as follows: [CO to tailor based on adjectival ratings utilized in the Source Selection Plan] Weighted Score Adjectival Rating 100 points Exceptional 90-99 points Very Good 20-89 points Acceptable Unacceptable Unacceptable Note 1: Any proposal that does not meet the standard for Technical Acceptability will be rated as  Unacceptable  under this factor and will be ineligible for award. Note 2: Any proposal that furnishes all required IRA-Eligible Material with a GWP better (lower) than GSA s Top 20% Limits will receive a Total Weighted Score of 90 points (Exceptional), with Raw Score Supplements potentially increasing the Total Weighted Score to 100 points. Note 3: If an EPD is not available, GSA will review the offeror s EPD Pledge. E. Noncompetitive Proposal Evaluation Requirements for Projects Requiring LEC Construction Materials GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements establish numeric global warming potential (GWP) limits for each of the EPA- approved construction material categories: concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel, and glass (IRA-Eligible Materials). For each material, GWP limits have been established for the best performing 20% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 20% Limits), the best performing Internal GSA Use Only - Page 13 40% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 40% Limits), and better than industry average (Better Than Average Limit). When procuring construction projects requiring concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel and/or glass, Contracting Officers will request that the offeror provide a proposal that favors provision of IRA-Eligible Materials with the lowest possible GWP. Depending on market research, certain IRA-Eligible Materials may be required to meet Top 20% Limits (see Market Research and Top 20% Materials, below). Instructional language and proposal requirement language are provided below. Contracting Officers shall work with PBS Project Teams to remove any IRA-Eligible Material present in the below table that is inapplicable to the project s anticipated material needs. Market Research and Top 20% Materials Where market research indicates, and the CIPMO confirms, that certain IRA-Eligible Materials with GWP values at or better than Top 20% Limits are available for a project or will be available by the anticipated contract award date, Contracting Officers shall substitute the following language for the fifth paragraph of the blue LEC Commitment Proposal language, below: For IRA-Eligible [INSERT IRA-ELIGIBLE MATERIALS THAT MUST MEET TOP 20% LIMITS], materials MUST have embodied GWP values that are less than or equal to GSA s Top 20% Limits. For all other materials, the proposal shall provide IRA-Eligible construction materials with embodied GWP values that are less than or equal to the GSA IRA Top 20% Limits reflected in GSA s IRA LEC asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements. If Top 20% materials are not available, please propose materials with embodied GWP that are less than or equal to the GSA IRA Top 40% Limit for that material. If Top 40% materials are not available for those material categories, please propose materials with embodied GWP that are less than the Better Than Average Limit for that material. NOTE: Where potential offerors indicate that IRA-Eligible Materials meeting mandatory Top 20% Limits are not available and, based on the Contracting Officer s and CIPMO s review, these indications appear well-founded, the Contracting Officer may consider amending the solicitation to relax the Top 20% Limit requirements for those materials, permitting submission of materials meeting Top 40% Limits or Better than Average Limits. The Construction Solicitation Template s (e.g., DB201A, C201 for Sole Source Procurements) Additional Proposal Requirements (typically Section II.C(2)) shall be amended by adding the below: LEC Commitment Proposal Internal GSA Use Only - Page 14 This project is funded in part by Section 60503 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which provides funding for purchase of construction materials with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions. GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements establish numeric global warming potential (GWP) limits for certain EPA- approved construction materials: concrete (and cement), asphalt, steel, and glass (IRA- Eligible Materials). For each material, GWP limits have been established for the best performing 20% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 20% Limits), the best performing 40% of materials in terms of embodied carbon (Top 40% Limits), and better than industry average (Better Than Average Limit). The Offeror is requested to provide a proposal that, to the maximum extent practicable, furnishes IRA-Eligible Materials with the lowest possible GWP values. IRA Limit commitments proposed by the Offeror will be incorporated into the resultant contract. Individual materials  GWP values may be found on individual manufacturers  environmental product declarations (EPDs). EPDs must meet the standards reflected in GSA s GSA s IRA Low Embodied Carbon asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements (see Compliance Documentation criteria listed for each IRA-Eligible Material). The proposal shall provide construction materials with embodied GWP values that are less than or equal to the GSA IRA Top 20% Limits reflected in GSA s IRA LEC asphalt, concrete (and cement), glass and steel requirements. If Top 20% materials are not available for certain material categories, please propose materials with embodied GWP that are less than or equal to the GSA IRA Top 40% Limit for that material. If Top 40% materials are not available for certain material categories, please propose materials with embodied GWP that are less than the Better Than Average Limit for that material. Where Top 20%, Top 40%, or Better Than Average materials are not available, please explain how you determined that to be the case, including providing details on search parameters, sources contacted, and available materials. The Offeror shall fill out the table below with the applicable IRA Limit they commit to meet for each IRA-Eligible Material: IRA-Eligible Material* IRA Limit Commitment (i.e., Top 20% Limit, Top 40% Limit, Better Than Average Limit) Concrete Specified concrete strength class (compressive strength [f'c] in pounds per square inch [PSI])   2499 PSI Internal GSA Use Only - Page 15 3000 PSI 4000 PSI 5000 PSI 6000 PSI  7200 PSI Cement** Concrete Masonry Units Asphalt Steel Fabricated Rebar Unfabricated Rebar Hollow Structural Sections (fabricated) Hollow Structural Sections from Electric Arc Furnaces (unfabricated) Hot-Rolled Sections (fabricated) Hot-Rolled Sections (unfabricated) Cold-Formed and Galvanized (stud, track, framing, etc.) Structural Steel Plate from Electric Arc Furnaces (unfabricated) Flat Glass * Required construction product assemblies (such as window assemblies) are included in IRA-Eligible Materials categories and will be bound by IRA Limit Commitments.

      "Summary": "Here's a comprehensive analysis:\n\n1. Policy Summary:\nThe document is the \"Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 Construction Solicitation Desk Guide\" detailing GSA's implementation guidelines for construction projects funded under the Inflation Reduction Act. It provides comprehensive instructions for solicitation, contract requirements, and sustainability efforts across three key areas: high-performance green buildings, low embodied carbon materials, and emerging sustainable technologies.\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nThis is a presidential proclamation regarding the flying of the United States flag at full-staff on Inauguration Day. The order specifically directs flag protocol for the day of inauguration and subsequent actions related to half-staffing in memory of former President Jimmy Carter.\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nThe executive order does NOT substantively impact the Inflation Reduction Act Construction Solicitation Desk Guide. The proclamation is purely a flag protocol document and contains no provisions that would alter GSA's procurement, construction, or sustainability policies.\n\nThe executive order:\n- Relates to flag display protocols\n- Concerns a specific day (Inauguration Day)\n- Has no bearing on construction, procurement, or sustainability practices\n\n4. Compliance Next Steps:\nNo compliance actions are required. The Inflation Reduction Act Construction Solicitation Desk Guide can continue to be implemented as originally drafted.\n\nRecommendation: File this executive order in standard administrative documentation without requiring any policy modifications.",

      "phase1_response": "## Policy Impact Analysis\n\n### 1. Policy Document Summary\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 Construction Solicitation Desk Guide is an internal GSA document that provides comprehensive guidance for construction projects involving IRA funding. The policy covers requirements for Low Embodied Carbon (LEC) construction materials, sustainability evaluation factors, solicitation procedures, technical specifications, and review processes. Key components include pre-solicitation requirements, evaluation criteria for sustainable materials, Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) requirements, and CIPMO review procedures for IRA-funded construction projects.\n\n### 2. Executive Order Summary\nProclamation 10885 of January 20, 2025, is a ceremonial order directing that the American flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day (January 20, 2025) and all future Inauguration Days. The order applies to the White House, all public buildings and grounds, military installations, naval facilities, and U.S. diplomatic facilities worldwide. After Inauguration Day ends, the flag returns to half-staff per the previous proclamation honoring former President Carter until the 30-day mourning period concludes.\n\n### 3. Executive Order Applicability Analysis\nThis executive order does **not apply** to the IRA Construction Solicitation Desk Guide policy. The executive order is purely ceremonial in nature, addressing flag display protocols for a specific commemorative occasion. It contains no provisions that would affect:\n\n- Construction project procedures or requirements\n- Sustainability standards or LEC material specifications  \n- Solicitation processes or evaluation criteria\n- Environmental compliance requirements\n- GSA's operational procedures for IRA-funded projects\n\nThe executive order operates in an entirely different policy domain (ceremonial protocols) than the construction guidance document (procurement and environmental standards). There is no substantive overlap between flag display requirements and construction project management procedures.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\nNo compliance actions are required because the executive order does not affect this policy. The IRA Construction Solicitation Desk Guide can continue to be implemented as written without any modifications related to this proclamation.\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

      "phase2_justification": "**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: Federal construction procurement under the Inflation Reduction Act, focusing on sustainability requirements, technical evaluation factors, and solicitation procedures for GSA construction projects.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: Ceremonial flag display protocol requiring full-staff flag display on Inauguration Day at federal properties.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact. The EO addresses symbolic ceremonial requirements that are completely separate from construction procurement processes. The flag display mandate applies to operational facilities regardless of their construction method or procurement history.\n\n4. **Supporting Language**: The EO specifically addresses \"flying the flag\" and \"full-staff\" requirements, while the policy fo",
      "phase2_response": "Let me analyze this step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**\nThe policy is the \"IRA of 2022 Construction Solicitation Desk Guide\" - this is a technical guidance document for federal construction projects under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It covers procurement procedures, sustainability evaluation factors, construction materials requirements, and submittal forms for GSA construction solicitations.\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**  \nThe executive order \"Flying The Flag Of The United States At Full-Staff On Inauguration Day\" (Proclamation 10885) addresses flag display protocols. It mandates that the U.S. flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day at federal buildings, military installations, and naval vessels.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nThese are entirely different domains:\n- Policy: Federal construction procurement and sustainability requirements\n- EO: Ceremonial flag display protocols\n\nThere is no direct operational intersection between construction solicitation procedures and flag display requirements. The EO does not modify procurement processes, environmental standards, or construction guidelines.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment**\nWhile both involve federal facilities, the connection is purely coincidental. The construction desk guide governs how GSA manages building projects, while the EO governs symbolic flag display. The EO's flag requirements would apply to completed federal buildings regardless of how they were constructed or procured.\n\n**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: Federal construction procurement under the Inflation Reduction Act, focusing on sustainability requirements, technical evaluation factors, and solicitation procedures for GSA construction projects.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: Ceremonial flag display protocol requiring full-staff flag display on Inauguration Day at federal properties.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: There is no direct or indirect impact. The EO addresses symbolic ceremonial requirements that are completely separate from construction procurement processes. The flag display mandate applies to operational facilities regardless of their construction method or procurement history.\n\n4. **Supporting Language**: The EO specifically addresses \"flying the flag\" and \"full-staff\" requirements, while the policy focuses on \"construction solicitation,\" \"sustainability evaluation factors,\" and \"LEC construction materials.\" These are distinct operational spheres with no overlap.\n\n5. **Edge Cases Considered**: Even though both may apply to the same federal buildings, they govern entirely different aspects - one governs how buildings are built/procured, the other governs ceremonial flag display at completed facilities. This coincidental applicability to the same physical structures does not create policy relevance.\n\nThe initial Phase 1 flag of \"Not Affected\" is correct.",

The main weakness is the incomplete final section, but the reasoning up to that point is sound and well-organized."

Kahua Reporting Requirements   Capital projects are required to be established in Kahua as part of the CILP submission process.   Under prospectus projects are required to be established in Kahua at the time of PCN creation (for BA54 projects) or at the time of work request assignment (for reimbursable projects).   Threshold for Capital Project vs Small Projects   For reporting purposes, project subtype in Kahua should be entered based on the size of the total project Estimated Construction Cost (ECC).   BA54 projects should be entered into Kahua as an Owned, Below Prospectus Projects.   For BA55 and BA80 funded projects:   If the ECC is above prospectus, the project should be entered and measured as an above prospectus (i.e., capital) project.   If the ECC is below prospectus, the project should be entered as an under prospectus (i.e., small) project.   Information maintained in Kahua is used for PBS reporting, dashboards, and measures.   Requirements for projects to be managed in Kahua are included in Deputy Commissioner Kahua Usage Memo (dated 8/12/2022).   Requirements for schedules and baselines are found in the FY24 Scheduling, Baseline, and Milestone Guidance document.   Requirements for Baseline Planned Obligations in Kahua are outlined in a project delivery alert, dated October 31, 2022.   Capital project data can be viewed on the Capital Program Dashboard.   A new project dashboard will be created in FY24 and will be used to provide data on capital, small, and reimbursable programs health indicators. Reporting requirements include the following project types:   New Construction Projects (BA51)   Minor Repair and Alteration Projects (BA54)   Major Repair & Alteration Projects (BA55)   Emergency Projects (BA56)   Feasibility, Program and Other Studies Supporting Larger Projects (BA61)   Historic Preservation Projects (BA64)   Reimbursable (BA80) Projects   Non-severable (A/B/N Type) RWA, including both those that are standalone RWAs or associated with a PBS funded project   Bi-partisan Infrastructure Law (All BA Codes)   Inflation Reduction Act (All BA Codes), including, but not limited to, energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs).

Capital Schedule Variance - External Measure & Internal Strategic Measure Description Efficient and timely delivery of capital projects benefits both PBS and its client agencies. It allows PBS to demonstrate effective stewardship of its capital funding, delivering projects timely to meet federal agency mission needs. There are opportunities to accelerate the project schedule in earlier project phases. Scope   New Construction (BA51)   Major Repair & Alteration (BA55). This includes Special Emphasis Programs (e.g. Consolidation, Fire / Life Safety, and Judicial Security).   Reimbursable (BA80) - Prospectus level stand-alone projects fully funded by client agencies that include construction scope (included in internal measure only) o o RWAs authorized at $10M+ are required to be in the internal measure set. RWAs authorized between Prospectus and $10M may be included in the internal measure set at the regional leadership s discretion.   Bi-partisan Infrastructure Law (All BA Codes)   Inflation Reduction Act (All BA Codes) Requirements Project milestones are entered into Kahua and are baselined within 90 days of GSA funding authorization or receipt and acceptance of a standalone RWA (referred to as  Project Fully Authorized for Execution & Funds in Place ). Baselines will generally not be changed once established. Exceptions will be handled on a case by case basis and may include the following:   For projects that receive supplemental Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding, a re-baseline may be permitted upon receipt of those funds. If a rebaseline is performed, project teams shall document the reasons for rebaselining and how receipt of IRA funds impacted the schedule.   Projects funded in phases. For example, if a project is funded for design only and receives a subsequent appropriation for construction, a rebaseline will be permitted upon receipt of construction funds.   Projects funded 100% by RWA where additional funds are provided by the customer to fund new scope, resulting in an impact to the schedule.   For phased projects (i.e., those that do not receive their entire appropriations at one time), as well as those those receiving IRA funds or funded 100% by RWA, the project team may request a rebaseline by providing the following to the Office of Project Delivery, Center for Customer Delivery: Source of funding     Description of scope Schedule impact   Impact to project outcomes (i.e., economic, rent, buying power at time of award, etc)   U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 10 Project Phases: Project phases are defined by these major milestones:   Site Acquisition: Project Fully Authorized for Execution & Funds in Place - Closing on Site / Possessory Judgment on Condemnation (if applicable)   Project Planning: Project Fully Authorized for Execution & Funds in Place - Design Award   Design: Design Award - Construction Notice To Proceed (NTP)   Construction: Construction NTP - Substantial Completion Definition of Success The target is a national measure. All of the regions share the same national target:   Internal   Level 5:   -5% behind total baseline schedule   Level 4:   Level 3: -10% to < -5% behind total baseline schedule (external measure target) -15% to < -10% behind total baseline schedule   External     -10 % behind total baseline schedule Metric Calculation Variance calculations use the following formula: Two different types of schedule variance calculations are used to report a complete picture of the schedule status depending on what phase the project is in: Cumulative Variance: Provides schedule variance across the entire project lifecycle. The baseline is from Project Fully Authorized for Execution & Funds in Place through Substantial Completion.   Baseline duration = Project Fully Authorized for Execution & Funds in Place date through the baselined construction Substantial Completion date.   Actual duration = Project Fully Authorized for Execution & Funds in Place date through the actual construction Substantial Completion date. Example: Cumulative Variance (Through Design Award) Project Authorization: 1/21/2022 Baselined Substantial Completion: 3/15/2024 Baselined Duration: 784 days Baselined Design Award: 6/1/2022 Actual Design Award: 9/1/2022 To Date Days Variance: -92 days (behind schedule) Cumulative Variance: -92 days / 784 days = -12% (behind schedule) Projects are measured based on their cumulative variance. The percentage calculated above is then weighted based on total project cost. A proportional variance is calculated based on the total cost of U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 11 all projects being measured in the FY for the region and nationally. Using the example above, if the total project cost was $10M and the total cost of all regional projects was $100M, then the -12% variance is multiplied by 10% to get -0.012. The regional score would then be the sum of all such variances for projects being measured in the FY. A similar calculation is performed based on the national total of all projects being measured in the FY. Clarifications   Measure Definition: CSV Internal Strategic Measure   Measure Definition: CSV External Measure (Annual Appropriations)   Measure Definition: CSV External Measure (BIL and IRA)   The Project Fully Authorized for Execution & Funds in Place milestone is the date when GSA receives full authorization and appropriation for BA51 and BA55 funded projects, or the date that GSA accepts an RWA for a stand alone RWA project.   For BA51 and BA55 projects,  full authorization  is defined as receiving authorizations from both the House and Senate, the public law signed by the President, and approval of any required spend plans. This is established by the Office of Portfolio Management and typically evident in the Capital Project Application (CPA) system, established by the OCFO. This will be sourced from Kahua once functionality is available.   Projects approved as part of a spend plan may have their Authorization milestone set to the date of spend plan approval if that date is later than the full authorization/appropriation date.   The first Construction Notice to Proceed date is required to be used for those projects where multiple Construction NTPs are issued.   If two major milestones are achieved in the same fiscal year, the latest milestone will be used for measurement purposes.   Milestones are measured during the year in which they are baselined through the year in which they are completed.   Disaster Relief Projects and Special Emphasis projects are excluded from this measure   Results for Capital Schedule Variance will be reported monthly. Results will be available in the Capital Program Dashboard. U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 12 6. Capital Projects On Budget - External Measure & Internal KPI Description PBS s customers, the American taxpayer, and Congress expect projects to be delivered within their Congressionally approved budgets. This metric measures the percentage of projects being delivered within these approved budgets. Staying within these budgets is an indicator of how well PBS is planning and managing scope, schedule, and budget. Scope   New Construction (BA51)   Major Repair & Alteration (BA55). This includes Special Emphasis Programs (e.g. Consolidation, Fire / Life Safety, and Judicial Security).   Bi-partisan Infrastructure Law (All BA Codes)   Inflation Reduction Act (All BA Codes)   Projects with a construction notice to proceed that will be substantially complete in FY24 or later. Requirements The Original Appropriation and Adjusted Appropriation are both tracked in the Capital Projects Application (CPA), with the amounts themselves approved by Congress. Kahua will serve as the data source for original and adjusted appropriation amounts once CPA functionality is consolidated in Kahua. Following is a summary of the adjustments that may be made to original appropriation amounts:   For measurement purposes, original appropriation amounts may be adjusted upwards for projects that receive funding in phases (example: site/design funds are appropriated in one year and construction in a subsequent year).   Projects that are part of a program funded via congressional authorization have flexibility to funds between projects based on changes in scope, project savings, project transfer cancellations, and contingency. Examples of these programs include   Consolidation Program   Capital Security Program   Fire and Life Safety   Energy and Water   BIL Projects Fluctuations in dollar value of these projects will be acceptable while using funds from the If funding outside of the program is necessary (i.e., a programmatic escalation or program. savings used from other line items or program s savings) then projects receiving these funds will be considered to have exceeded the threshold for remaining On Budget.   Special considerations for IRA funding:   Projects receiving supplemental IRA funding will have the funding added to the original appropriation amount. Supplementing existing projects with IRA funding is encouraged.   Projects not meeting the On Budget metric may use supplemental IRA funding to reduce or eliminate a previously needed escalation. The IRA funds can only be used for scope as defined in the IRA. The project will need to return the prior escalation to Central Office as savings in order to change the project to being On Budget. U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 13 Definition of Success The target is a national external measure and national internal KPI. All of the regions share the same national target:   Internal KPI   Level 5:  85% of projects within original appropriation   Level 4: 80% to 85% of projects within original appropriation (External measure target)   Level 3: 75% to 80% of projects within original appropriation   External Measure    80% of projects within original appropriation Metric Calculation Each project is assessed by comparing the Original Appropriation with the Adjusted Appropriation. The Original Appropriation is the amount provided to GSA by Congress as part of the normal funding cycle, including additional phases where appropriate. The Adjusted Appropriation is the amount of appropriated or authorized funds currently available to the project. This figure also includes out of cycle funds, such as escalations and reprogramming. A project is considered to be  On Budget  if the Original Appropriation is greater than or equal to the Adjusted Appropriation. On Budget (Project): Original Appropriation (Project)   Adjusted Appropriation (Project) The Capital Projects On Budget score is calculated by dividing the number of projects considered to be  On Budget  by the total number of projects in the measures set. This score is calculated regionally and nationally. Projects are added to the measures set 60 days after the confirmation of full funding authorization. Projects exit the measure set at the end of the fiscal year when substantial completion is achieved. Clarifications   Measure / KPI Definition: Capital Projects On-Budget   Projects funded via emergency funding such as hurricane relief funds will not be entered into the measure set due to the complexity of defining an all encompassing scope of the repairs needed.   Results for Capital Projects On Budget will be reported monthly. Results will be available in the Capital Program Dashboard. U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 14 7. Percent of Capital Projects Planned Obligations Achieved - Internal Strategic Measure Description Capital project planned obligations and award baselines measure and promote accuracy of obligating authorized funds. This metric evaluates PBS s ability to meet obligation goals on a macro level by tracking actual obligations for major awards or milestones throughout the fiscal year and helps gauge PBS s progress on project delivery throughput. The metric will also help ensure PBS meets any congressionally established deadlines for obligating funds (IRA funding, for example). Scope In order to accurately forecast planned obligations and the performance of achieving those plans, all capital projects with the following funding types are required to be input, baselined, and regularly updated in Kahua:   New Construction (BA51)   Major Repair & Alteration (BA55). This includes Special Emphasis Programs (e.g. Consolidation, Fire / Life Safety, and Judicial Security).   Bi-partisan Infrastructure Law (All BA Codes)   Inflation Reduction Act (All BA Codes) Requirements Planned / Baselined awards are entered in Kahua in the PM Forecast and Baseline Obligations app. FMIS will be the source of actual obligations. Note: Once Kahua financial integrations are fully operational, actual obligations may be pulled from Kahua. What to Baseline: All initial awards and exercising of contract options, including Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) options, are required to be reported and linked to a milestone in the project schedule. These include but are not limited to:   Contracts related to the National Environmental Policy Act   Site acquisition activities   Pre-design services (i.e., programming studies, phasing analysis, and design/ build request for proposals)   Design Services (Architect / Engineers)   Construction (all delivery method types)   Art In Architecture   Management and inspection services, and Commissioning. Note: Routine change orders are not required to be reported or baselined. Timing: Planned obligations are required to be entered into Kahua as follows:   Projects funded in prior fiscal years will have until November 30, 2023, to enter their obligation plans and baseline them for FY24 and beyond. U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 15   Newly authorized projects or existing projects that receive supplemental funding shall be baselined within 90 calendar days of said funding being authorized or spend plan approval, as applicable.   During the course of the fiscal year, project teams provide updates to planned award dates and amounts.   Project teams will be permitted to rebaseline obligations at the beginning of each fiscal year. Definition of Success Strategic Measure All regions share the same national targets and scoring will be calculated as a national percentage rather than at the individual regional level.   Level 5:  90% of planned obligations achieved   Level 4: 85% to <90% of planned obligations achieved   Level 3: 80% to <85% of planned obligations achieved Metric Calculation PBS will be measured on the total obligations (by dollar value) compared to the total dollar value of obligations that were basedlined for a given Fiscal Year. Only actual obligations with a corresponding baseline will be counted for purposes of this measure. In cases where an obligation is baselined for one fiscal year but an award is made prior to the start of that fiscal year, the actual award amount will be added to both the numerator and denominator of the above calculation for the fiscal year in which the award actually occurred. For example:   If an award is baselined for October 15, 2024, in the amount of $50 million, but the award is actually made in the amount of $40 million on September 15, 2024, then for purposes of calculating FY24 results for this measure, both the numerator and denominator in the calculation above will be adjusted upward by $40 million. Similarly, if an obligation is made in an amount different from what is baselined, both the numerator and denominator in the above calculation will be adjusted to reflect the actual amount of the obligation. Only baselined obligations that are not made in the FY they are planned will negatively impact the scoring method above. Percent of Obligations =  (         )         +       Clarifications   Measure Definition: Percent of Capital Projects Planned Obligations Achieved   The process for entering baselined award information into Kahua is outlined in the Kahua Baseline Obligations QRG. U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 16   Award baselines should match their corresponding Kahua milestones. After award baseline information has been entered into Kahua, data validation will be performed to ensure the correct contract types are included, the sequence of baselined awards is logical, and that the total estimated award amounts for a project fall within the available funding (less contingency).   If projects are split funded (for example, BA55 + BA80), only the portion of the obligations that will use the budget activities listed above are required to be baselined.   For FY24, all planned obligations for funded projects are required to be input in Kahua. Obligations that are baselined for future FYs will have the opportunity to be rebaselined at the beginning of FY25.   Results for Planned Obligations will be reported monthly. Results will be available in the Capital Program Dashboard. Reporting will include planned and actual obligations.   This information will also be used to provide obligational forecasts for senior leadership. U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 17 8. Construction Projects On Schedule (BIL and IRA) - External Measure & Internal KPI Description This measure evaluates PBS s ability to manage projects to their established construction schedules. Measuring construction schedules supports important management controls on project delivery that help mitigate delays and requires project teams to keep scope aligned with schedule and budget parameters. This metric determines the percent of applicable projects in the construction phase that are being delivered within +10% of the baselined duration of construction. Projects are reported throughout the construction phase, beginning at Construction Start / Notice to Proceed, through Substantial Completion. Projects are officially measured once they reach substantial completion. Scope   BIL Paving Projects (BA13)   FMCSA Projects funded by BIL (BA13)   Under Prospectus Projects (BA54) with an IRA funding component Requirements Project teams shall ensure their schedules / milestones are kept updated in Kahua. At the time the actual Construction Start / NTP date is entered in Kahua, a snapshot will be taken to capture the actual NTP date, along with the planned substantial completion date. The planned substantial completion date shall serve as the  baseline  for purposes of this metric. Once actual substantial completion is achieved, it shall be entered into Kahua within 14 calendar days. Definition of Success: Successful performance related to this KPI is defined as 72.7% or more of projects on schedule. Clarifications:   Measure Definition: Projects (BIL & IRA) On Schedule   There is not a rebaselining process. The emphasis is on managing to the schedule, communication with stakeholders on changes, and documenting the reason for changes in the project status as they occur. U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 18 9. Small Project Delivery On-Schedule / On-Budget - Internal KPI Description This metric evaluates project schedules and construction budgets during the construction phase of projects. Tracking schedule and budget promotes important management controls on projects to mitigate costly overruns and schedule delays. It encourages the project team to keep the scope aligned with schedule and budget parameters. This metric also provides a benefit to taxpayers by discouraging increased costs on construction projects and helps federal customers achieve their mission by providing new space to them on agreed upon timeframes.   Schedule: Calculates the baseline versus actual schedule duration between the Construction Start/NTP and the Substantial Completion Actual for the entire project.   Budget: Compares the total construction obligations at Substantial Completion to the construction obligations at Construction or Design/Build Award. Scope   Small projects in federal space, with an actual substantial completion date in FY24   Total project funding is greater than $50K   Included Budget Activities:   Repair and Alterations (BA54)   Reimbursable Work (BA80 - A & N Type RWA s)   Special Emphasis Program (BA55), (e.g., Consolidation, Fire/Life, and Judicial Security)   Historic Preservation (BA64)   Split funded projects (for example, BA54/80)   Projects not included:   Projects with total funding less than $50k; procurement related RWAs in leased space; Building Operations (BA61); RWAs for furniture, fixtures and equipment (FFE); study only projects; severable RWAs; non-construction RWAs.   Disaster relief projects are excluded. Requirements   Schedule: Project teams shall ensure their schedules / milestones are kept updated in Kahua. At the time the actual Construction Start / NTP date is entered in Kahua, a snapshot will be taken to capture the actual NTP date, along with the planned substantial completion date. The planned substantial completion date shall serve as the  baseline  for purposes of this metric. Once actual substantial completion is achieved, it shall be entered into Kahua within 14 calendar days.   Budget: Project teams shall ensure the correct ASIDs / Work Items and RWAs are associated with their projects in the project funding details in Kahua. No other special data input or other intervention by the PM is required for purposes of tracking this. The original construction obligation will be automatically captured once the transaction is in Pegasys. Mods following the initial construction award will also be captured automatically. Definition of Success Successful performance related to this KPI is defined as 73% of projects on schedule and 73% of projects on budget. U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 19 Metric Calculation Schedule: Actual schedule duration between Construction Start/NTP and Substantial Completion divided by Baselined duration. A project is considered to  pass  this metric if the actual project duration is less than or equal to +10% of the baselined duration. Schedule Example: John Smith Federal Building Renovation   Planned Duration: Construction Start/NTP (3/1/24) to SCD Baseline (6/1/24): 92 days   Actual Duration: Construction Start/NTP (3/1/24) to SCD Actual (6/6/24): 97 days   Calculation: (97/92) - 1 = +5.4%   Result: Actual duration (97 days) is within +10% of baseline duration (92 days) Budget: Construction obligations (Base Contract + Base Contract Options + Change Order Modifications) at substantial completion divided by the construction obligations (Base Contract + Base Contract Options) at construction award. A project is considered to  pass  this metric if the total construction obligations are within +10% of the original contract award amount (plus base contract options priced at the time of initial construction contract award). Budget Example: John Smith Federal Building Renovation   Construction Obligations at Construction Award: $100,000   Construction Obligations at ASCD: $109,000   Calculation: ($109,000/$100,000) -1 = +9%   Result: Construction obligations total at substantial completion (i.e. $109,000) is within +10% of construction obligations (i.e. $100,000) at construction contract award Clarifications   KPI Definition: FY24 Small Project Delivery On-Schedule and On-Budget KPI   There is not a rebaselining process. Since schedule and budget are not reported as a measure, the emphasis is on managing to the schedule, communication with stakeholders on changes, and documenting the reason for changes in the project status as they occur.   Obligations are sourced from FMIS based on RWAs and ASID / Work Item associated with the project in Kahua.   In cases where options are priced at the time of initial construction award, manual adjustments may be required. In these cases, please contact the OPD Measures and Reporting team to make adjustments. U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 20 10. RWA Acceptance to Award - Internal KPI Description This KPI tracks the number of non-severable, non-recurring RWA projects where the first award was processed in the current fiscal year (regardless of start date). The KPI aims to identify RWAs that are obligated within a  reasonable time . Timeliness in awarding work against RWA projects promotes  getting off to a good start  in an effort to deliver on schedule, and furthermore, faster obligation time improves customer service and further supports customer missions. Scope Accepted RWAs meeting the following criteria are included in this KPI:   A, B, D, and N type RWAs   All dollar thresholds are included   Only non-severable RWAs are included   RWAs with TI Scenario 1 (initial occupancy in leased space) are excluded Requirements No special data input or other intervention by the PM is required for purposes of tracking this KPI. All accepted RWAs meeting the above conditions are automatically included based on data from RETA. Once an obligation has been made, that first award date will automatically flag an RWA for inclusion in this KPI. The first award date will be sourced from FMIS. Definition of Success An RWA scores  green  if the first award is made within the following timeframes for the respective dollar thresholds (based on authorized amount):   $0 - $50k: within 90 days of acceptance   $50k - $250k: within 120 days of acceptance   $250k+: within 180 days of acceptance In alignment with the PBS Acquisition Scorecard, the following targets have been established:   Level 5:   70% of RWAs score  green    Level 4: 60% to <70% of RWAs score  green    Level 3: 50% to <60% of RWAs score  green    Level 2: 40% to <50% of RWAs score  green    Level 1: <40% of RWAs score  green  U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 21 Metric Calculation  Acceptance to Award  is calculated as the number of days from the date an RWA is accepted to the time it takes to make the first award, based on transactions posted to Pegasys. That duration is calculated as follows: (Post Date of first obligation transaction in Pegasys) - (RWA Acceptance / Start Date) The timeframes outlined in the section above are established for an RWA to be considered  green  or having met the target based on the authorized amount range. An RWA is considered  yellow  if the first obligation is made within 30 days of the targets established above. An RWA is considered  red  if the first obligation is made 31 or more days following the target. Clarifications   KPI Definition: FY24 - RWA Acceptance to Award KPI   RWAs that have been accepted but do not yet have an obligation are reported as  Unobligated .   An RWA does not impact the overall score for this KPI until there is an award against it.   Results for this KPI are updated daily. Results are available in the RWA Dashboard on D2D.

Background. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins, and has never been hacked. As a result of its scarcity and security, Bitcoin is often referred to as  digital gold . Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The United States Government currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a policy to maximize BTC s strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system. Just as it is in our country s interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United States Digital Asset Stockpile that can serve as a secure account for orderly and strategic management of the United States  other digital asset holdings. Sec. 3. Creation and Administration of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  Stra- tegic Bitcoin Reserve,  capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency (agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to sub- section (d) of this section (Government BTC). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Govern- ment BTC held by it to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. Government BTC deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law. (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  United States Digital Asset Stockpile,  capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Stockpile Assets). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Stockpile Assets held by it to the United States Digital Asset Stockpile and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine strategies for responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile in accordance with applicable law.

However, the United States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other than in connection with crimi- nal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. (d)  Government Digital Assets  means all Government BTC and all Stock- pile Assets. The head of each agency shall not sell or otherwise dispose of any Government Digital Assets, except in connection with the Secretary of the Treasury s exercise of his lawful authority and responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, as required by law, or in cases where the Attorney General or other relevant agency head determines that the Government Digital Assets (or the proceeds from the sale or disposition thereof) can and should: (i) be returned to identifiable and verifiable victims of crime; (ii) be used for law enforcement operations; (iii) be equitably shared with State and local law enforcement partners; or (iv) be released to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705, 28 U.S.C. 524(c), 18 U.S.C. 981, or 21 U.S.C. 881. (e) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment considerations for establishing and managing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile going forward, including the accounts in which the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile should be located and the need for any legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order or the proper management and administration of such accounts. Sec. 4. Accounting. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall provide the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets with a full accounting of all Govern- ment Digital Assets in such agency s possession, including any information regarding the custodial accounts in which such Government Digital Assets are currently held that would be necessary to facilitate a transfer of the Government Digital Assets to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or the United States Digital Asset Stockpile. If such agency holds no Government Digital Assets, such agency shall confirm such fact to the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets within 30 days of the date of this order. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. 6 C O D Z E R P _ R F h t i w D O R P 3 2 N Q X 1 1 K S D n o r e t t o l VerDate Sep<11>2014 17:24 Mar 10, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\11MRE3.SGM 11MRE3 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 46 / Tuesday, March 11, 2025 / Presidential Documents 11791 (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

      "Summary": "Policy Analysis Summary:\n\n1. Policy Text Summary:\nThe document is a comprehensive GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) policy for FY24 Capital, Small, and Reimbursable (RWA) Programs. It outlines 12 key measures and reporting requirements for project management, including:\n- Kahua Reporting Requirements\n- Project Schedule and Budget Tracking\n- Construction and Demolition Waste Diversion\n- Various Performance Metrics for Project Delivery\n\n2. Executive Order Text Summary:\nThe executive order establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile, managed by the Treasury Department. It focuses on:\n- Consolidating government-held digital assets\n- Creating controlled custodial accounts for Bitcoin and other digital assets\n- Establishing guidelines for managing and potentially using these digital assets\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nAfter careful review, this executive order DOES NOT directly impact the GSA Public Buildings Service project management policy. \n\nRationale:\n- The policy is focused on construction project management and reporting\n- The executive order is specifically about digital asset management\n- There are no intersections between project delivery metrics and digital asset governance\n- No provisions in the executive order mandate changes to GSA project management processes\n\n4. Compliance Next Steps:\nNo immediate action is required. Standard policy review and update processes should continue as normal.\n\nRecommendation:\nMonitor future executive orders and digital asset regulations for potential future impacts on GSA project management procedures.\n\nDisclaimer: This analysis is based on the documents provided and represents an initial policy review. Consultation with legal and policy experts is recommended for definitive interpretation.",

Brief Summary of the Policy Text\n\nThe GSA policy document outlines implementation guidance for FY24 Capital, Small, and Reimbursable Work Authorization (RWA) Programs. It establishes measures and reporting requirements across 12 key areas, including:\n- Kahua system reporting and reconciliation requirements\n- Capital project schedule variance and budget performance metrics\n- Construction project timeline tracking for infrastructure programs (BIL & IRA)\n- Small project delivery performance indicators\n- RWA processing timeframes\n- Construction and demolition waste diversion requirements\n\nThe policy focuses on project delivery performance measurement, reporting compliance, and operational efficiency metrics for GSA's Public Buildings Service projects.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of the Executive Order Text\n\nExecutive Order 14233 establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. The order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to create an office to manage custodial accounts for Bitcoin (BTC) holdings from criminal/civil asset forfeiture proceedings and civil penalties. The executive order is based on the premise that Bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21 million coins creates strategic value as \"digital gold,\" and positions the U.S. to capitalize on digital assets as a store of value in the global financial system.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability\n\nThis executive order **does not apply** to the GSA Capital Programs policy for the following reasons:\n\n**Scope Mismatch**: The executive order specifically addresses digital asset management and cryptocurrency reserves under Treasury Department jurisdiction, while the GSA policy governs physical infrastructure project delivery, performance metrics, and construction management.\n\n**Jurisdictional Separation**: The executive order assigns responsibilities to the Treasury Department for digital asset custodial services, whereas the GSA policy operates within the General Services Administration's Public Buildings Service domain for capital improvements and facility management.\n\n**Operational Focus Divergence**: The GSA policy deals with tangible construction projects, schedule adherence, budget performance, and waste management\u2014none of which intersect with digital asset storage, Bitcoin reserve management, or cryptocurrency policy implementation.\n\n**No Financial Asset Management Overlap**: While both documents involve government asset management, they address entirely different asset classes\u2014the GSA policy manages physical real estate and construction projects, while the executive order manages digital financial instruments.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\n\n**No compliance actions are required** because the executive order does not affect this GSA policy. The Capital Programs policy should continue operating under its current framework without modification related to this executive order.\n\nHowever, GSA leadership may want to monitor future guidance from Treasury regarding whether any digital asset considerations might eventually affect federal procurement or project financing mechanisms in subsequent policy updates.\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

This covers construction project delivery, budget management, schedule compliance, and performance measurement systems using the Kahua platform.\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**\nThe executive order establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and US Digital Asset Stockpile, focusing on cryptocurrency policy, digital asset management, and the federal government's approach to Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nThese are fundamentally different domains:\n- **Policy Domain**: Physical infrastructure project management, construction delivery, and facilities management\n- **EO Domain**: Digital asset policy and cryptocurrency reserves\n\nThere is no direct operational overlap between managing construction projects/building services and establishing a Bitcoin reserve. The policy deals with tangible infrastructure delivery while the EO addresses intangible digital asset strategy.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment**\nWhile both involve federal government operations, they operate in completely separate spheres with no meaningful intersection. The Bitcoin reserve establishment would not affect how GSA manages construction schedules, budgets, or reporting requirements for physical building projects.\n\n**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: GSA Public Buildings Service infrastructure project management, encompassing capital construction projects, small projects, and reimbursable work authorizations with specific focus on delivery timelines, budget compliance, and performance reporting.\n\n2. **EO Domain**: Federal cryptocurrency and digital asset policy, specifically the establishment of strategic Bitcoin reserves as part of national financial strategy.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: No direct or meaningful indirect impact exists. The EO's establishment of a Bitcoin reserve operates entirely within the financial/monetary policy sphere and would not alter GSA's construction project management processes, reporting requirements, or delivery methodologies. The policy's focus on Kahua platform utilization, schedule variance tracking, and construction project metrics remains completely independent of digital asset policy.\n\n4. **Supporting Evidence**: The policy text exclusively addresses physical infrastructure delivery mechanisms, while the EO text focuses solely on cryptocurrency as \"digital gold\" and strategic financial reserves. No language in either document suggests intersection points.\n\n5. **Edge Case Consideration**: Even considering potential indirect effects (such as broader federal budget implications), the EO would not specifically impact GSA's established project delivery processes or measurement systems detailed in this policy.",

Overview The President signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), P.L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429, on November 15, 2021 providing $3,418,008,000 to the U.S. General Services Administration for various work on border stations and land ports of entry. Throughout this document this act will be referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The relevant enacted language from the Act is as follows:  For an additional amount to be deposited in the  Federal Buildings Fund , $3,418,008,000, to remain available until expended, for construction and acquisition, and repairs and alterations of border stations and land ports of entry, of which no more than $250,000,000 shall be for Program Contingency and Operational Support for necessary expenses for projects funded under this heading, including, moving governmental agencies (including space alterations and adjustments, and telecommunications relocation expenses) in connection with the assignment, allocation and transfer of space, leasing of temporary space, and building operations, of which  (1) $2,527,808,000 shall be for projects on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection five-year plan; (2) $430,200,000 shall be for projects with completed U.S. Customs and Border Protection/General Services Administration feasibility studies as prioritized in the  American Jobs Plan Project List  submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on May 28, 2021; and (3) $210,000,000 shall be for land ports of entry (LPOE) infrastructure paving; acquisition of leased LPOEs; and additional Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration requirements at the Southern Border: Provided, That the General Services Administration shall submit a plan, by project, regarding the use of funds made available to the Administrator under this heading in this Act to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 90 days of enactment of this Act: Provided further, That the Administrator of General Services shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate quarterly on the obligations and expenditures of the funds provided under this heading in this Act by account of the Federal Buildings Fund: Provided further, That funds made available under this heading in this Act for Federal Buildings Fund activities may be transferred to, and merged with, other accounts within the Federal Buildings Fund only to the extent necessary to meet program requirements for such activities: Provided further, That the General Services Administration will provide notice in advance to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate of any proposed transfers: Provided further, That funds made available to the Administrator under this heading in this Act shall not be subject to section 3307 of title 40, United States Code: Provided further, That amounts made available under this heading in this Act shall be in addition to any other amounts made available for such purposes, including for construction and acquisition or repairs and alterations: Provided further, That such amount is designated by the Congress as being 3 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A for an emergency requirement pursuant to section 4112(a) of H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, and to section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.  The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) Office of Budget (BB), Financial Management (BG), and Office of PBS Financial Services (BR), together with the Public Buildings Service (PBS), drafted this guidance document for the management of the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) BIL funds. B. New Accounting Codes 1. Fund 192J Fund 192J has been established in GSA s accounting system, Pegasys, for the use of PBS, and will be used specifically for the obligation of FBF funds appropriated by the BIL. The Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) for fund 192J is the same as the FBF; TAS 47X4542. Please note that the FBF, which is the traditional funding vehicle for PBS, is a no-year quasi-revolving fund and permits PBS to use new obligational authority until expended. As the enacted language states,  For an additional amount to be deposited in the  Federal Buildings Fund , $3,418,008,000, to remain available until expended .. , fund 192J will be structured as a no-year fund in Pegasys . BIL obligations and expenses must not be included in the regular FBF 192X account and reported as such, due to special reporting requirements stipulated for these funds under the Act and apportionment by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Therefore, for ease of reporting, the BIL funding must be tracked and managed separately, using a new fund (fund 192J). For financial reporting, all obligations and outlays will still be reported under the Federal Buildings Fund TAS 47X4542. 2. Budget Activities The BIL appropriated funds in five different spending categories. In order to track and manage each category within the spending plan and apportionment, five budget activities within 192J are created and listed below. These are established for use in fund 192J only, and cannot be used in fund 192X.   PG11 CBP LPOE Five Year Plan Projects: Land Ports of Entry (LPOE) projects on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection five-year plan.   PG12 AJP Priority LPOE Projects: projects with completed U.S. Customs and Border Protection/General Services Administration feasibility studies as prioritized in the  American Jobs Plan Project List  submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on May 28, 2021. 4 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A   PG13 LPOE Paving, Acquisition of Leased LPOE, and FMCSA Projects: for LPOE infrastructure paving; acquisition of leased LPOEs; and additional Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) requirements at the Southern Border.   PG14 Program Contingency: This budget activity will be used for project contingency funds.   Per the public law:  no more than $250,000,000 shall be for Program Contingency and Operational Support for necessary expenses for projects funded under this heading, including, moving governmental agencies (including space alterations and adjustments, and telecommunications relocation expenses) in connection with the assignment allocation and transfer of space, leasing of temporary space, and building operations.    PG15 Operational Support: This budget activity will be used for operational support costs. This funding is capped at $250,000,000 along with the contingency.   Per the public law: no more than $250,000,000 shall be for Program Contingency and Operational Support for necessary expenses for projects funded under this heading, including, moving governmental agencies (including space alterations and adjustments, and telecommunications relocation expenses) in connection with the assignment allocation and transfer of space, leasing of temporary space, and building operations.   At this time, PBS does not plan to issue allowances for operational support from the BIL. Please see section C  Tracking PBS Operating Expenses Related to BIL . All current budget activities in fund 192X will continue to be used only for FBF activities as appropriated, and will not be available under fund 192J. Regular 192X and BIL 192J funding can be used in conjunction with each other on LPOE projects. These situations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in coordination with OCFO, PBS Portfolio, Office of the General Counsel, and the LPOE Program Management Office (PMO). The use of funds for PG11, PG12, PG13, PG14, and PG15 will be directly tied to the approved spending plan. The regions must adhere to the project list as provided in the spend plan. 3. Function Codes and SOCs The existing Function Codes and Sub-Object Classes (SOCs) for 192X will be used for fund 192J. Please apply accounting classification codes in accordance with normal coding guidelines depending on the purchase. Please refer to the PBS Standardized Coding website to find more information. 5 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A C. Tracking PBS Operating Expenses Related to BIL At this time, PBS does not plan to issue allowances for operational support from the BIL and all operating costs will be funded from regular FBF fund 192X. It is still necessary to track 192X costs related to executing the BIL projects. Tracking code Y0000BIL was set up in order to track BIL expenses paid for by regular 192X funding. 1. Travel At this time, all travel continues to be paid from 192X BA60. All travel in Concur for a BIL project need to cite the Y0000BIL tracking code. This code has been loaded in Concur for certain organization codes related to BIL. If the coding for your organization does not appear, please contact your Building Operations budget analyst. 2. Labor Coding/Timecarding Every PBS employee is to follow current business rules regarding timecarding their labor hours to function codes, buildings, projects, and reimbursable work authorizations (RWAs). Employees who work on BIL projects need to code their time to the specific projects as normal. Effective with the pay period beginning 9/25/22 (pay period ending 10/08), those who spend administrative time on BIL work need to code their time to Y0000BIL in HRLinks using the region s dummy building number. This does not apply to SES or PMO employees, or to PBS employees who can code time to individual projects or RWAs. Employees who work full time on BIL projects within the LPOE PMO do not need to timecard to the Y-code as their organization code is already delineated as full time BIL. Please see section E.4 for more information on General & Administrative (G&A) allocation. 3. All Other Management Support contract employees who are not working on a specific project must be coded to Sub Object Class H03 (Contract labor) with tracking code, Y0000BIL. The tracking code will enable GSA to separate out embedded contract employees from other types of contracts. The LPOE PMO must be notified of all new management support contracts supporting the BIL prior to award. All other costs not included in a project or in the BIL spend plan, but related to the BIL, such as training, will continue to use the Y0000BIL code for tracking in 192X. D. Requesting BIL Funds BIL funds will be managed by the PMO through internal tracking and spend planning. As regions prepare to make awards, regions should follow the standard allowance 6 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A request process, with BIL process clarifications below, to obtain the project funding in Pegasys. 1. Allowance Process For PG11-PG14, OCFO PBS Budget Division (BBP) will send instructions for regional project and budget teams to create line item project numbers in IRIS. The best practice is for regions to plan to request project allowances for each major project phase, including appropriate contingency, ensuring appropriate time before award, usually once contract awards are pending. The following procedural requirements for issuing allowances shall be followed:   All allowance request packets must be submitted to the allowance request mailbox (allowance.requests@gsa.gov).   The regional program office must coordinate with the zonal budget analyst to prepare the GSA form 3285 allowance request.   A completed GSA Form 3285 is required as an attachment to the allowance request email. The form must be filled out in its entirety to include all regional approving persons, the appropriation, and the amount that the region is requesting. Also, the description section must include which national spend plan the region is requesting funds from and the purpose for how the funds will be obligated. In addition to the GSA Form 3285, regions need to provide any applicable supporting documents to verify the actual award amount, such as, the contractor's proposal (i.e., Standard Form 1442), to support the allowance request.     Note: for all BIL studies (site acquisition, NEPA, pre-design) allowances, regions may provide the Independent Government Estimate as support.   The zonal budget office will then attach the GSA form 3285, supporting documents, spend plan and submit the funds request email to the Central Office allowance request mailbox (allowance.requests@gsa.gov).   Upon receiving the allowance request, BBP will review the allowance request and then forward the request for approval to the LPOE PMO and Office of Portfolio Management & Customer Engagement. Please allow a lead-time of approximately two days for the Central Office to review and concur.   After OCFO approvals have been obtained, BBP will complete the project allowance in Pegasys. After receiving notification that the allowance has been processed, the regional budget analyst must establish an operating plan (A5 level) in Pegasys.   The new PBS project management system, Kahua, will be automating the allowance creation and approval process. Once that feature is implemented, allowances will be created and routed in Kahua. 7 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A E. Pegasys 1. Pegasys Templates New Pegasys templates and budget activities have been added for fund 192J. Accounting templates for the below organization codes have been created for fund 192J. Templates for additional organization codes can be added as needed, please contact BBP with any questions or to request an organization code. Regional Org Codes available for 192J: An LPOE PMO has been established within Region 2. All PMO costs must be coded to organization code P02L0001. Pegasys accounting templates with the P02L0001 organization code have been created for 192X PG60, PG61 and 192J PG15. 2. Purchase Cards (non-travel) Purchase card users must log their BIL-related transactions into Pegasys using fund 192J, and must remember to perform a timely reconciliation. Any purchase must be in accordance with the approved BIL spend plan and directly supporting a BIL project. Regions must follow all current credit card processes; 192J is available in the credit card bot. 3. Reports The following is a list of Pegasys reports that have been created to include fund 192J financial activity. Business Intelligence (BI) databases will be updated to include transactions from 192J. These reports can be found directly in Pegasys or in BI. 8 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A   FR83AB   Allowance/Budget Plan Status Report   Trial Balance Report   Month-end Obligation Status Reports Income & Expense (I&E) Reports     Fixed Asset Trial Balance Report     ULO Database   Quarterly Commitments and Obligations Report for quarterly reporting to Inventory Status Report Congress (as requested in the act) Additionally, activity will be tracked on the below dashboard as updated by PBS and OCFO:   PMO Financial Tracking Report 4. General & Administration Allocation Fund 192J transactions that are coded without a building number, project number or RWA number will go into the various PBS G&A pools; the particular pool classification will depend on the distribution level of the organization code, just as with other Fund 192 indirect transactions. Likewise, fund 192J direct transactions against a particular building will factor into the distribution of the G&A pools just as with other Fund 192 direct transactions. All regions should evaluate the impact of 192J funding on their workloads when determining the new workload factors for FY23 and forward. As most 192J funding is anticipated to be related to capital projects, regions should pay special attention to the impact on the capitalization factors. The Pegasys cost allocation module and the I&E reports will include the 192J fund transactions in with the other Fund 192 transactions to produce one official set of regional and nationwide FBF I&E reports. For more information, please contact Stefanie Crane at 202-528-8178. 5. Cost Transfers Cost transfers occur after funds are expensed. Cost transfers often correct coding errors or reflect changes in coding decisions. They do not require approval by OMB or Congress, but may require explanation after the fact to OMB, Congress or auditors. Cost transfers can be between funds, budget activities, or projects. Because of the BIL's unique requirements for transparency and because of the multiple levels of review for BIL obligations and expenses, cost transfers initiated by regions are strongly discouraged. No cost transfers may be initiated without prior approval from the OCFO Zonal RWA/Capital Projects Director with the concurrence of BBP. Regions shall request cost transfers between the FBF (192X) and the BIL fund (192J) only when the original obligation is clearly in error, or when the identified scope is clearly miscoded. Likewise, regions will request cost transfers between Budget Activities within 192J only when the original obligation is in error. 9 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A All requests for cost transfers must be submitted by the zonal OCFO capital projects budget analyst and must be submitted to the OCFO Zonal RWA/Capital ProjectsDirector for concurrence, and finally to the BBP Capital Projects team for review and concurrence. This process is for approval only. Once the request is approved, the region must transfer the costs by following normal procedures. F. Property In addition to the PBS Property Accounting Handbook, the following guidance is provided to address the specific changes that must be accomplished due to the BIL. 1. Establishing 192J Funded Projects Projects exceeding $50,000 from 192J funds must be assigned a capitalized Accounting System Identification (ASID) in PBS s Inventory Reporting Information System (IRIS), while projects under $50,000 must be assigned an expensed ASID. Because it is PBS  s policy to capitalize at the ASID level, only one ASID should be used even if the project is funded through 192X and 192J. If the ASID is funded by 192X and 192J, IRIS users need to indicate in the appropriate field that the project is multiple funded and select the corresponding Budget Activity. If a project is funded solely from 192J, the ASID number will be assigned based on the type of work conducted, similar to PBS s process under 192X. Each ASID number should tie back to the original project line item number (or LIN) and, while each project can have multiple ASIDs, there must only be one project line item number for each 192J funded project. New construction projects must continue to be assigned N- type ASIDs. These ASIDs will be funded from Budget Activities PG11 (CBP LPOE Five Year Plan Projects), PG12 (AJP Priority LPOE Projects), PG13 (LPOE Paving, Acquisition of Leased LPOE, and FMCSA Projects) and PG14 (Project Contingency). Should a region have a blended new construction/R&A project, please consult with zonal budget and BBP. Repair and Alteration (R&A) projects exceeding the current prospectus limit will continue to be assigned V-type ASIDs for construction and non-advanced design. Currently, there are no advanced design projects that should be assigned S-type ASIDs under 192J. All R&A projects under prospectus will be assigned R-type ASIDs. The spending plan will list the appropriate budget activities and ASID types to be recorded into IRIS for these projects. Traditionally, LPOE project are funded through new construction using N-type ASIDs; however, depending on the scope of the project, the project may need to be coded as a R&A project and could be funded from PG11-PG14 (if deemed necessary and approved by BBP and the Capital Assessment and Allocation Division (PTB)). Should there be any operating costs funded by BIL, ASIDs will not be required for PG15 (Operating Costs). 10 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A PG14 funds will be used as a source for additional project contingency through a stringent governance process managed by the PMO. Regions should plan to stay within the standard construction contingency for their projects, which is already part of the PG11, 12 and 13 project budgets as included in the spend plan. Regions will need approval from the PMO to receive a budget increase from the PG14 program contingency. If approved, funds will be allowed in PG14 and the contingency accounting string will need to be used on the project. Therefore, PG14 costs related to a specific construction project must cite the N, S, V, or R-type ASID for that project and use the same LIN. Fund type 192J: Budget Activity Line item type PG11 PG12 PG13 PG14 PG15 N, L, R N, L, R N, L, R N, L, R n/a ASID type N, V, R N, V, R N, V, R N, V, R R An IRIS National Priority Code is not needed for Fund 192J. IRIS now has the capability to assign ASIDs to the 192J funded budget activities. As previously discussed, IRIS users need to check the multiple fund indicator for the ASID with the appropriate Budget Activity Code in IRIS. For any environmental-related cleanup costs, a separate ASID with expensed accounting treatment will need to be established for any environmental work items. See Chief Financial Officer Manual, Volume 3, OCFO 4260.3 (May 23, 2019), Chapter 5: Expenses, Part 4 for more details. 2. Monitoring Capitalized Projects As PBS receives additional funding under 192J for existing projects, the capitalization status of projects may change since the scope of work and/or dollar amount may change. For example, if a project originally was expensed since it was primarily for repairs, but additional funding allows PBS to improve the asset beyond its original condition, it must be capitalized if it exceeds PBS s capitalization threshold of $50,000. The capitalization threshold is based on the ASID s delivered orders under both funds and under all budget activities. If a project's capitalization status changes, the Regional IRIS Power User must first adjust the work category code and send an email to PBS.Property@gsa.gov informing BGP of the change and reason. The BGP Property Team will then request financial system adjustments as needed. 11 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A Estimated Substantial Completion Date (ESCD): The ESCD is the planned date for the asset to be ready for its intended purpose, regardless of funding code. The estimated SCD should be updated and maintained in IRIS throughout the life of the project. If the scope of work will change due to additional 192J funds, regional associates should adjust the date as soon as a date is established. Additionally, study, design, and construction award dates should also be entered as incurred to ensure IRIS reflects the proper project status. Actual Substantial Completion Date (ASCD): The ASCD is the actual date the asset can be operated or occupied, even though minor repairs or construction may be needed. It is the date when PBS inspects, approves and determines that work has been performed to bring the project to the degree of completion that is necessary for the asset to be used for its intended purpose. Associated construction or physical, or financial completion dates, that are associated with the project shall not delay reporting of the ASCD. Depreciation: Once the project reaches substantial completion and the ASCD is entered into IRIS, project costs will transfer from the construction-in-process to the completed buildings accounts and depreciation will be recorded. The useful lives of projects, which are based on project type, will remain unchanged, regardless if funded completely or partly under fund 192J.

RWA Tracking The following guidance applies to RWA acceptance and processing for RWAs that support GSAs BIL projects, specifically RWAs from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment. Intake Process: Regions will follow standard PBS RWA policy (Reimbursable Work Authorizations National Policy Manual, PBS 1000.2B (August 1, 2020), as revised). In addition, BIL LPOE RWAs must be approved by the LPOE PMO before accepted by PBS. The LPOE PMO will maintain a list of projected CBP RWAs funded with CBP BIL funding. Note: CBP RWAs funded with BIL funding will contain the following TAS, which indicates the RWA is funded from BIL: 070 2022 2026 0530000 *070 is connected to CBP agency bureau code, then the year of the appropriation and the year of expiration of obligational authority. 0530 is an identifier for O&S projects (CBP s BIL projects) 12 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A Reminder: Any B-type RWAs must be associated with a Project Control Number and ASID code connecting it to the GSA-funded portion of the work (usually V-type or N- type). In addition, the associated PCN must be entered in the PCN field in RETA (see screenshot below). For additional assistance please contact your RWA financial point of contact. H. PBS Systems The following PBS systems have been modified to include the new fund 192J financial activity: a. Kahua b. Capital Projects Application (CPA) c. Business Intelligence/Business Objects d. RETA e. Inventory Reporting Information System (IRIS) 13 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A f. REXUS g. ULO database Because these systems rely heavily on templates, not every system can accept every possible combination of fund code, budget activity code, organization code, and project code. If you have trouble entering obligations or other transactions, please first check to be sure that you have made no errors, then contact your local budget analyst for further assistance. I. FY 2022 and Beyond $3.418 billion in BIL funding is available for FY22 and beyond as no-year funding. Beginning with the FY2024 Budget Call, OCFO will start estimating impacts to budgets as a result of any completed BIL projects. For example, utilities, cleaning, and maintenance costs will need to be budgeted in the appropriate fiscal year for any new LPOEs or completed projects coming online. 14 DocuSign Envelope ID: 7808D437-0B9B-42AF-9024-32EF79B4FA5A",

Purpose. Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single- sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women s domestic abuse shelters to women s workplace showers. This is wrong. Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system. Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself. This unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts. Invalidating the true and biological category of  woman  improperly trans- forms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept. Accordingly, my Administration will defend women s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male. Sec. 2. Policy and Definitions. It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Under my direc- tion, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpre- tation of and application of Federal law and administration policy: (a)  Sex  shall refer to an individual s immutable biological classification as either male or female.  Sex  is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of  gender identity.  (b)  Women  or  woman  and  girls  or  girl  shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively. (c)  Men  or  man  and  boys  or  boy  shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively. (d)  Female  means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell. (e)  Male  means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that pro- duces the small reproductive cell. (f)  Gender ideology  replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true.

Gender ideology is internally incon- sistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body. (g)  Gender identity  reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex. Sec. 3. Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men. (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order. (b) Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. Each agency should therefore give the terms  sex ,  male ,  female ,  men ,  women ,  boys  and  girls  the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications. (c) When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term  sex  and not  gender  in all applicable Federal policies and documents. (d) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage- ment shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees  sex, as defined by section 2 of this order. (e) Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, com- munications, or other internal and external messages that promote or other- wise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. Agency forms that require an individual s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity. Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology. (f) The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single- sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act. This position is legally untenable and has harmed women. The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities. In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent. (g) Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology. Sec. 4. Privacy in Intimate Spaces. (a) The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that males are not detained in women s prisons or housed in women s detention centers, including through amend- ment, as necessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act.

(c) The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate s appearance to that of the opposite sex. (d) Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity. Sec. 5. Protecting Rights. The Attorney General shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In accordance with that guidance, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the General Counsel and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act shall prioritize inves- tigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified. Sec. 6. Bill Text. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs shall present to the President proposed bill text to codify the definitions in this order. Sec. 7. Agency Implementation and Reporting. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, each agency head shall submit an update on implementa- tion of this order to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. That update shall address: (i) changes to agency documents, including regulations, guidance, forms, and communications, made to comply with this order; and (ii) agency-imposed requirements on federally funded entities, including contractors, to achieve the policy of this order. (b) The requirements of this order supersede conflicting provisions in any previous Executive Orders or Presidential Memoranda, including but not limited to Executive Orders 13988 of January 20, 2021, 14004 of January 25, 2021, 14020 and 14021 of March 8, 2021, and 14075 of June 15, 2022. These Executive Orders are hereby rescinded, and the White House Gender Policy Council established by Executive Order 14020 is dissolved. (c) Each agency head shall promptly rescind all guidance documents incon- sistent with the requirements of this order or the Attorney General s guidance issued pursuant to this order, or rescind such parts of such documents that are inconsistent in such manner. Such documents include, but are not limited to: (i)  The White House Toolkit on Transgender Equality ; (ii) the Department of Education s guidance documents including: (A)  2024 Title IX Regulations: Pointers for Implementation  (July 2024); (B)  U.S. Department of Education Toolkit: Creating Inclusive and Non- discriminatory School Environments for LGBTQI+ Students ; (C)  U.S. Department of Education Supporting LGBTQI+ Youth and Families in School  (June 21, 2023); (D)  Departamento de Educacio  n de EE.UU.

Brief Summary of Policy Text\nThe GSA memorandum from September 28, 2022, provides financial execution guidance for the $3.4 billion appropriated to the Federal Buildings Fund under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law). The policy establishes new tracking requirements for program support costs, including specific accounting codes, labor coding procedures for administrative hours, and timecarding requirements for PBS employees working on BIL-related activities.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text\nExecutive Order 14168, signed January 20, 2025, titled \"Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\" directs federal agencies to use language and policies that recognize biological sex distinctions. The order specifically defines women as \"biologically female\" and men as \"biologically male,\" rejecting gender self-identification policies that allow access to single-sex spaces and activities based on gender identity rather than biological sex.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability\nThis executive order **does not apply** to the GSA policy document for the following reasons:\n\n- **Subject Matter Scope**: The GSA memorandum is purely focused on financial tracking, accounting procedures, and budget execution for infrastructure projects. It contains no language, policies, or provisions related to gender, sex, single-sex facilities, or gender identity issues.\n\n- **Operational Focus**: The policy addresses administrative and financial processes such as tracking codes, timecarding procedures, fund allocation, and accounting strings. These technical financial management procedures are unrelated to the gender ideology and biological sex recognition issues addressed in the executive order.\n\n- **No Relevant Content**: After reviewing the available portions of the GSA memorandum, there are no references to facilities design, restroom policies, workplace accommodations, or any other areas where gender/sex distinctions would be relevant to the executive order's requirements.\n\n- **Different Policy Domains**: The executive order targets policies that involve sex-based classifications, single-sex spaces, and gender identity accommodations, while the GSA policy operates in the financial management and accounting domain.\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\nNo compliance actions are required because the executive order does not apply to this policy. The GSA memorandum can continue to be implemented as written without modification related to Executive Order 14168.\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",
      "phase2_flag": "Not Affected",
      "phase2_justification": "**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: Federal building infrastructure funding, financial tracking, and accounting procedures for GSA's Federal Buildings Fund under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: Gender ideology restrictions, biological sex definitions, and access to single-sex spaces and facilities across federal operations.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: While both involve federal facilities, the connection is indirect and speculative. The policy is purely administrative, focused on financial tracking mechanisms (accounting codes, fund management) rather than facility design, operations, or access policies. The executive order, while it may eventually affect how federal buildings operate regarding single-sex facilities, does not directly impact the financial gui",
      "phase2_response": "**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**\nThe policy focuses on federal building infrastructure funding and financial administration. Specifically, it provides guidance for the General Services Administration's Public Buildings Service on tracking and accounting for $3.4 billion in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act appropriations to the Federal Buildings Fund, including establishing specific accounting codes and tracking requirements.\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**\nThe executive order addresses gender ideology and biological sex definitions in federal policy. It focuses on preventing individuals from self-identifying as a different biological sex to access single-sex spaces and activities, particularly protecting women's spaces like domestic abuse shelters and workplace facilities.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nThese domains are fundamentally different - one deals with infrastructure finance and accounting, the other with gender policy and facility access rights. However, there is a potential intersection point: federal buildings managed by GSA may contain single-sex facilities (restrooms, locker rooms, etc.) that could be affected by the executive order's requirements regarding biological sex definitions.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment Considering Context**\nWhile the phase1_flag indicates \"Not Affected,\" I must consider whether the executive order could impact how federal buildings funded through this infrastructure guidance are designed, configured, or operated regarding single-sex facilities.\n\n**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: Federal building infrastructure funding, financial tracking, and accounting procedures for GSA's Federal Buildings Fund under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: Gender ideology restrictions, biological sex definitions, and access to single-sex spaces and facilities across federal operations.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: While both involve federal facilities, the connection is indirect and speculative. The policy is purely administrative, focused on financial tracking mechanisms (accounting codes, fund management) rather than facility design, operations, or access policies. The executive order, while it may eventually affect how federal buildings operate regarding single-sex facilities, does not directly impact the financial guidance and tracking requirements established in this memorandum.\n\n4. **Key Language Supporting Determination**: The policy text is entirely procedural, stating \"PBS must use tracking code Y0000BIL in the accounting string for non-labor program requirements using 192X funding.\" There are no provisions related to facility design, user access, or operational policies that would be directly affected by gender ideology restrictions.\n\n5. **Nuances Considered**: Although GSA manages federal buildings that may contain single-sex facilities, this particular policy document addresses only the financial and accounting aspects of infrastructure funding. Any impact from the executive order would more likely affect separate GSA operational policies or building management directives, not this specific financial guidance memorandum.

THOMAS ACTING ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OFFICE OF LEASING (PR) STUART BURNS ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OFFICE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT (PT) Subject: LEASING ALERT (LA-21-06) - Strategic Direction on Lease Terms During and Following the COVID-19 Pandemic This memorandum issues enhanced guidance to PBS offices engaged in planning, negotiating and awarding U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) leases during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance is intended to provide high level guidance on setting lease terms requirements during and following the COVID-19 pandemic and are considering expanding telework. This guidance is in addition to the Leasing Alert issued April 20, 2016 entitled Lease Term Strategy. In March 2020, because of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the Federal Government moved to a mandatory, full-time telework status. Because the Government is still largely in a full-time telework status, many agencies are unsure of their future space requirements. GSA is concerned about a potential surge in short term lease extensions. These short term extensions would result in an anticipated increased cost to the taxpayers, and an associated best manage its workload. U.S. General Services Administration 1800 F Street, NW Washington, DC 20405-0002 www.gsa.gov Therefore, in response to the uncertainty of - term space needs and the potential vacancy risk, GSA is adjusting its suggested approach when determining the length of lease terms. First, GSA must continue to consider how a particular lease transaction aligns with the portfolio strategies of the local market and the customer agency and the degree of financial risk the Public Buildings Service (PBS) is prepared to assume when entering into leases on behalf of a customer agency. Second, the following lease term strategies should be considered: For agencies that submit their long term lease requirements, longer term leases (greater than 10 years) should be considered particularly when the agency requires a specialized facility, to perform their mission critical work (e.g., the judiciary, federal inspection agencies operating at land ports of entry, law enforcement components and those agencies using laboratory spaces). For agencies that submit their short term lease requirements but are still determining their long term space requirements, short term leases (4-6 years) should be considered. This 4-6 year term will allow agencies time to finalize their long term space requirements, while providing GSA time to procure and build out the space. Page 2 of 2",

Purpose. Federal regulations should not predetermine economic winners and losers. Yet some regulations operate to exclude new market entrants. Regulations that reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innova- tion as well as the benefits they create for American consumers should be eliminated. This order commences the process for eliminating anti-com- petitive regulations to revitalize the American economy. Sec. 2. Definitions. (a)  Agency  has the meaning given to it in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code, except that it does not include the Executive Office of the President or any components thereof. (b)  Agency head  means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director, unless otherwise specified in this order. Sec. 3. Rescinding Anti-Competitive Regulations. (a) Agency heads shall, in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (Chair- man) and the Attorney General, complete a review of all regulations subject to their rulemaking authority and identify those that: (i) create, or facilitate the creation of, de facto or de jure monopolies; (ii) create unnecessary barriers to entry for new market participants; (iii) limit competition between competing entities or have the effect of limiting competition between competing entities; (iv) create or facilitate licensure or accreditation requirements that unduly limit competition; (v) unnecessarily burden the agency s procurement processes, thereby lim- iting companies  ability to compete for procurements; or (vi) otherwise impose anti-competitive restraints or distortions on the oper- ation of the free market. (b) Within 70 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall each provide to the Chairman and the Attorney General a list of regulations identified by the categories specified in subsection (a) of this section. Agency heads shall also include a recommendation as to whether each of the listed regulations warrants rescission or modification in light of its anti-competitive effects. For recommended modifications, agency heads shall briefly specify what modification is appropriate. For regulations that are anti-competitive by design, agency heads shall provide a justification for their anti-competitive effects if the agency head is not proposing rescission or modification. (c) In conducting the review required by subsection (a) of this section, agency heads shall prioritize review of those rules that satisfy the definition of  significant regulatory action  in Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended. (d) Within 10 days of the date of this order, the Chairman shall issue a request for information (RFI) that seeks public input on the identification of regulations that fall within the categories specified in subsection (a) of this section, as well as comments explaining the proposed classifications.

(e) Within 90 days of receipt of the agency lists specified in subsection (b) of this section, the Chairman, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the relevant agency heads, shall provide to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) a consolidated list of regulations that warrant rescission or modification in light of their anti-competitive effects, along with rec- ommended modifications. The Chairman may include on the consolidated list regulations not originally included on an agency list if such regulations fall within at least one of the categories outlined in subsections (a)(i)  (vi) of this section. (f) Upon receipt of the consolidated list described in subsection (e) of this section, the OMB Director, through the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, shall consult with the Chairman, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the relevant agency heads to decide whether to incorporate the proposed rescissions or modifications into the Unified Regulatory Agenda developed pursuant to Executive Order 14219 of February 19, 2025 (Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President s  Department of Government Efficiency  Deregulatory Initiative).

      "Summary": "Policy Analysis Summary\n\n1. Policy Summary:\nThe GSA Public Buildings Service Memorandum (May 7, 2021) provides strategic guidance for leasing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Key points include:\n- Addressing uncertainty in federal agency space requirements due to widespread telework\n- Recommending lease term strategies based on agency needs:\n  * Longer-term leases (>10 years) for mission-critical facilities\n  * Shorter-term leases (4-6 years) for agencies still determining long-term space needs\n- Aiming to manage potential surge in short-term lease extensions and associated costs\n\n2. Executive Order Summary:\nExecutive Order 14267 (April 9, 2025) focuses on:\n- Reducing anti-competitive regulatory barriers\n- Requiring agencies to review regulations that:\n  * Create monopolies\n  * Limit market competition\n  * Create unnecessary entry barriers\n  * Impose unnecessary procurement restrictions\n- Mandating a comprehensive review of existing regulations to identify and potentially rescind anti-competitive rules\n\n3. Applicability Analysis:\nWhile the leasing policy does not appear to directly create anti-competitive barriers, it may be subject to review under the executive order's broad scope. Potential areas of scrutiny include:\n- Lease term recommendations that might inadvertently limit market competition\n- Potential constraints on real estate market flexibility\n- Procurement-related considerations in lease acquisition\n\n4. Recommended Next Steps:\na) Conduct an internal review of the leasing policy to:\n   - Assess potential anti-competitive implications\n   - Document the policy's market impact\n   - Prepare justification for current lease term strategies\n\nb) Prepare documentation for the required 70-day agency head review, specifically addressing:\n   - How current lease strategies support market competition\n   - Flexibility in lease term approaches\n   - Rationale for current leasing guidance\n\nc) Collaborate with the Federal Trade Commission and Attorney General's office during the review process\n\nd) Be prepared to modify the policy if recommended by the comprehensive regulatory review\n\nDisclaimer: This analysis is a preliminary assessment. The organization should consult legal and procurement experts for a definitive interpretation of the executive order's impact on the existing leasing policy.",

Brief Summary of the Policy Text\n\nGSA Leasing Alert LA-21-06, issued May 7, 2021, provides guidance to PBS offices on lease term requirements during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy addresses concerns about potential short-term lease extensions due to agencies' uncertainty about future space needs while operating under expanded telework arrangements. The guidance aims to help GSA avoid increased costs to taxpayers and manage workload effectively by adjusting the approach to determining lease term lengths, considering portfolio strategies, customer agency needs, and financial risk management.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of the Executive Order Text\n\nExecutive Order 14267, signed April 9, 2025, directs federal agencies to eliminate anti-competitive regulations that create barriers to market competition. The order requires agency heads to review all regulations under their authority and identify those that: create monopolies, establish unnecessary barriers to entry, limit competition between entities, create burdensome licensure requirements, unnecessarily burden procurement processes, or impose other anti-competitive restraints on free market operations.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability\n\nThis executive order **does apply** to the GSA leasing policy for the following reasons:\n\n**Procurement Process Impact**: The leasing guidance directly affects GSA's procurement processes by establishing criteria for lease term determinations. Under section 3(a)(v) of the executive order, regulations that \"unnecessarily burden the agency's procurement processes, thereby limiting companies' ability to compete for procurements\" must be reviewed.\n\n**Potential Competitive Barriers**: The policy's emphasis on avoiding short-term lease extensions and preference for certain lease term lengths could potentially:\n- Limit opportunities for smaller or newer property management companies who might be more flexible with shorter terms\n- Create barriers for property owners who prefer shorter lease arrangements\n- Reduce competitive bidding opportunities if lease terms become too standardized\n\n**Market Participant Access**: The guidance's focus on portfolio strategies and financial risk management could inadvertently create barriers to entry for new market participants in the federal leasing sector.\n\n### 4. Next Steps to Achieve Compliance\n\nTo ensure compliance with Executive Order 14267, GSA should:\n\n1. **Conduct Comprehensive Review**: Analyze LA-21-06 alongside all other leasing policies to identify provisions that may limit competition or create barriers to market entry.\n\n2. **Stakeholder Consultation**: Engage with the Federal Trade Commission Chairman and Attorney General as required, plus industry stakeholders including property owners, real estate developers, and leasing companies of various sizes.\n\n3. **Market Impact Assessment**: Evaluate whether the lease term guidance has created unintended competitive disadvantages for certain types of property providers or limited market participation.\n\n4. **Policy Revision**: Modify the guidance to ensure maximum competitive opportunities while maintaining cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency. This may include:\n   - Expanding flexibility in lease term options\n   - Ensuring procurement processes don't favor established players\n   - Removing any unnecessary barriers to participation by new market entrants\n\n5. **Implementation Timeline**: Establish a clear timeline for policy review and revision consistent with the executive order's requirements.\n\n**Final Determination: [Affected]**",

While the executive order doesn't specifically mention real estate or leasing, GSA's leasing policies are regulatory in nature and can create significant market effects.

      "phase2_response": "**Step 1: Policy Domain/Subject Area**\nThe policy focuses on **federal real estate leasing and property management** during the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides strategic guidance to GSA's Public Buildings Service on lease terms, negotiations, and awards, with specific consideration for expanded telework arrangements following the pandemic.\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain/Subject Area**\nThe executive order addresses **regulatory reform and competition policy**, specifically targeting the elimination of anti-competitive regulatory barriers that exclude market entrants and predetermine economic winners and losers.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nWhile these appear to be different domains at first glance, there is a meaningful intersection. Federal leasing policies and practices can significantly impact commercial real estate markets and create barriers for potential lessors seeking to do business with the government.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment**\nThe GSA leasing guidance could contain requirements or preferences that favor certain types of properties, locations, or lessors over others, potentially creating anti-competitive effects in the commercial real estate market. The executive order's broad mandate to eliminate regulations that \"exclude new market entrants\" and \"predetermine economic winners and losers\" would apply to leasing policies that create such barriers.\n\n**Final Decision: [Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: Federal real estate leasing strategy and lease term requirements for government facilities during and after COVID-19.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: Elimination of anti-competitive regulatory barriers across federal agencies to promote market competition and innovation.\n\n3. **Direct/Indirect Impact Analysis**: The impact is **indirect but substantial**.

The GSA guidance on \"setting lease terms requirements\" could contain provisions that limit competition in federal real estate markets.\n\n5. **Nuances Considered**: The COVID-19 context and telework considerations in the policy might lead to location or facility requirements that inadvertently favor certain market segments. The executive order's comprehensive scope (\"Federal regulations should not predetermine economic winners and losers\") encompasses any regulatory guidance that could have anti-competitive effects, regardless of the specific policy domain.\n\nThe connection exists through the potential anti-competitive effects of federal leasing requirements on commercial real estate markets, making this policy subject to review under the executive order's mandate.",

Background. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins, and has never been hacked. As a result of its scarcity and security, Bitcoin is often referred to as  digital gold . Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The United States Government currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a policy to maximize BTC s strategic position as a unique store of value in the global financial system. Just as it is in our country s interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United States Digital Asset Stockpile that can serve as a secure account for orderly and strategic management of the United States  other digital asset holdings. Sec. 3. Creation and Administration of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  Stra- tegic Bitcoin Reserve,  capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency (agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to sub- section (d) of this section (Government BTC). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Govern- ment BTC held by it to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. Government BTC deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law. (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the  United States Digital Asset Stockpile,  capitalized with all digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC, that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Stockpile Assets). Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Stockpile Assets held by it to the United States Digital Asset Stockpile and shall submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine strategies for responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile in accordance with applicable law.

However, the United States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other than in connection with crimi- nal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency without further executive or legislative action. (d)  Government Digital Assets  means all Government BTC and all Stock- pile Assets. The head of each agency shall not sell or otherwise dispose of any Government Digital Assets, except in connection with the Secretary of the Treasury s exercise of his lawful authority and responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, as required by law, or in cases where the Attorney General or other relevant agency head determines that the Government Digital Assets (or the proceeds from the sale or disposition thereof) can and should: (i) be returned to identifiable and verifiable victims of crime; (ii) be used for law enforcement operations; (iii) be equitably shared with State and local law enforcement partners; or (iv) be released to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C. 9705, 28 U.S.C. 524(c), 18 U.S.C. 981, or 21 U.S.C. 881. (e) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment considerations for establishing and managing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile going forward, including the accounts in which the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile should be located and the need for any legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order or the proper management and administration of such accounts. Sec. 4. Accounting. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall provide the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets with a full accounting of all Govern- ment Digital Assets in such agency s possession, including any information regarding the custodial accounts in which such Government Digital Assets are currently held that would be necessary to facilitate a transfer of the Government Digital Assets to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or the United States Digital Asset Stockpile. If such agency holds no Government Digital Assets, such agency shall confirm such fact to the Secretary of the Treasury and the President s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets within 30 days of the date of this order. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

The reasons are:\n- The document is an administrative guidance for contract management\n- It does not involve digital asset management or cryptocurrency\n- The executive order focuses on Treasury and agency-level digital asset handling\n- The COR Desk Guide is a procedural manual for contract administration\n\n4. Compliance/Next Steps:\nNo specific compliance actions are required for this policy document. The COR Desk Guide can continue to be used as-is without modification based on this executive order.\n\nRecommendation: No action needed. Continue following existing COR Desk Guide procedures.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this analysis?",

      "phase1_response": "## Policy Analysis: Executive Order 14233 Impact on GSA COR Desk Guide\n\n### 1. Brief Summary of Policy Text\nThe policy document appears to be the U.S. General Services Administration's Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) Desk Guide for Building Services Contracts, which provides contract administration guidance for PBS (Public Buildings Service) contracting operations. This guide likely contains procedures, responsibilities, and protocols for GSA personnel managing building services contracts.\n\n### 2. Brief Summary of Executive Order Text\nExecutive Order 14233, signed March 6, 2025, establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile. The order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to create an office to manage custodial accounts for Bitcoin (BTC) holdings obtained through criminal/civil asset forfeiture proceedings or civil money penalties. The order positions Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" and emphasizes the strategic advantage of early adoption of cryptocurrency reserves due to Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins.\n\n### 3. Detailed Explanation of Executive Order Applicability\nThis executive order does **not directly apply** to the GSA COR Desk Guide for Building Services Contracts. Here's the detailed analysis:\n\n**Scope Differences:**\n- The executive order specifically targets the Treasury Department for establishing and managing digital asset reserves\n- The GSA policy focuses on contract administration for building services (facilities management, maintenance, etc.)\n- No mention of digital assets, cryptocurrency, or Bitcoin-related procurement in the building services context\n\n**Agency Jurisdiction:**\n- The executive order assigns primary responsibility to the Treasury Secretary\n- GSA's role in this context would be limited to potential administrative support services, if any\n- Building services contracts typically involve physical infrastructure, not financial asset management\n\n**Operational Impact:**\n- The COR Desk Guide procedures for building services contracts would not require modification based on this executive order\n- No new compliance requirements are imposed on GSA's building services contracting operations\n- The executive order does not mandate changes to existing GSA contract administration procedures\n\n### 4. Next Steps for Compliance\nSince the policy is not affected, no compliance steps are required. However, GSA should:\n\n**Monitoring Actions:**\n- Stay informed about any subsequent implementation guidance that might involve GSA administrative support\n- Be prepared to provide facilities or administrative services to Treasury's new digital asset office if requested through proper channels\n- Continue standard contract administration procedures without modification\n\n**Potential Future Considerations:**\n- Monitor for any follow-up executive orders or agency guidance that might involve GSA services\n- Maintain awareness of how the new Treasury office might require GSA building services or administrative support\n\n**Final Determination: [Not Affected]**",

      "phase2_justification": "**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: Federal contract administration and building services management under GSA's Public Buildings Service, focusing on COR responsibilities and procedural guidance.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: National digital asset strategy and cryptocurrency reserve establishment, creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as part of federal financial policy.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: No direct or indirect impact exists. The EO establishes a bitcoin reserve without modifying procurement laws, contract administration requirements, or building services protocols. The policy's operational focus on contract oversight remains unchanged by digital asset reserve policies.\n\n4. **Supporting Language**: The EO text focuses entirely on \"strategic bitcoin reserve,\" \"digital asset stockpile,\" and c",
      "phase2_response": "**Step 1: Policy Domain Identification**\nThe policy \"COR Desk Guide | Building Services Contracts\" operates in the domain of federal contract administration and management, specifically focused on Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) responsibilities for building services contracts under the General Services Administration's Public Buildings Service (PBS).\n\n**Step 2: Executive Order Domain Identification**\nExecutive Order 14233 operates in the domain of digital asset policy and financial reserves, specifically establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile as part of national financial strategy.\n\n**Step 3: Domain Comparison and Impact Assessment**\nThese domains are fundamentally distinct with no overlap:\n- The policy addresses procurement processes, contract oversight, and building maintenance services\n- The executive order addresses cryptocurrency reserves and digital asset management strategy\n\nThere is no direct impact as the EO does not modify procurement regulations, contract administration procedures, or building services requirements. There is also no meaningful indirect impact, as establishing a bitcoin reserve does not alter how CORs manage building services contracts or their administrative responsibilities.\n\n**Step 4: Independent Assessment**\nDespite the phase1_flag indicating \"Not Affected,\" I conducted an independent review. The policy deals with operational contract management while the EO establishes a strategic financial reserve. These represent entirely separate government functions with no intersecting requirements or implications.\n\n**Final Decision: [Not Affected]**\n\n**Full Justification:**\n\n1. **Policy Domain**: Federal contract administration and building services management under GSA's Public Buildings Service, focusing on COR responsibilities and procedural guidance.\n\n2. **Executive Order Domain**: National digital asset strategy and cryptocurrency reserve establishment, creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as part of federal financial policy.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**: No direct or indirect impact exists. The EO establishes a bitcoin reserve without modifying procurement laws, contract administration requirements, or building services protocols. The policy's operational focus on contract oversight remains unchanged by digital asset reserve policies.\n\n4. **Supporting Language**: The EO text focuses entirely on \"strategic bitcoin reserve,\" \"digital asset stockpile,\" and cryptocurrency as \"digital gold,\" with no mention of procurement, contracts, or building services. The policy text addresses \"contract administration for PBS Contracting\" with no financial reserve components.\n\n5. **Nuances Considered**: I examined potential indirect connections such as whether digital asset reserves might affect federal spending on building services or procurement procedures, but found no substantive links. The EO's scope is limited to reserve establishment and does not extend to operational procurement activities.",

While more verbose than the SME justification, it arrives at the identical conclusion through sound logical analysis. The Model effectively separates the two policy domains (contract administration vs. digital assets) and correctly identifies no overlap or impact. The structured approach actually enhances clarity by systematically addressing domain separation and impact analysis. The core reasoning - that digital asset management policies don't affect building service contract administrative procedures - is perfectly aligned between both justifications. The Model's expanded detail could be valuable for documentation purposes, though the SME's conciseness is equally valid for the determination."
